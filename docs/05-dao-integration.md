# Integration with ENS DAO and Tokenomics

## Alignment with Decentralized Governance

The Oversight Committee operates under the authority of the ENS DAO, ensuring that governance remains decentralized and community-driven within the Ethereum ecosystem. Key aspects include:

- **Proposal Submission**: Major initiatives, changes to standards, or policy shifts proposed by the committee require approval from the DAO on Ethereum.

- **Budget Approval**: Funding requests and allocations are subject to DAO governance on Ethereum, promoting fiscal responsibility and transparency.

## Utilization of ENS Tokens

ENS tokens play a central role in facilitating governance and aligning incentives within the Ethereum ecosystem:

- **Voting Rights**: Token holders participate in electing committee members and approving proposals on Ethereum, ensuring that decisions reflect the collective will.

- **Staking Mechanisms**: Service providers may be required to stake ENS tokens as part of the accreditation process, aligning their financial interests with the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Funding and Sustainability

Sustainable funding is essential for the committee's operations within the Ethereum network. Funding sources may include:

- **ENS Treasury Allocations**: A portion of ENS DAO funds, derived from registration fees and renewals on Ethereum, allocated to support committee activities.

- **Accreditation Fees**: Reasonable fees charged to service providers undergoing the accreditation process, scaled to avoid burdening smaller entities within the Ethereum ecosystem.

- **Grants and Partnerships**: Securing grants from aligned organizations or partnerships with entities that support the advancement of ENS on Ethereum.

Expenses will cover administrative costs, security audits, infrastructure for collaboration, and educational initiatives within the Ethereum network.
