The mission directly addresses the need identified in the ENS DAO community for a standardized approach to service provider integration while ensuring that security and reliability remain paramount across all implementations.


The board consists of seven members representing diverse expertise: two Technical Experts with deep knowledge of ENS architecture and implementation details; one Security Specialist focusing on blockchain security to address potential vulnerabilities that could damage the ecosystem; two Service Provider Representatives from established integrations to ensure standards remain practical; one User Advocate representing the interests of end-users who rely on ENS services daily; and one Legal/Compliance Advisor with regulatory expertise to navigate the evolving landscape around digital identity and naming services.

Board members serve 2-year terms (staggered initially) to ensure continuity while allowing for fresh perspectives. Members are elected through token-weighted voting with public vetting, aligning with ENS DAO's commitment to decentralized and community-driven governance. The decision-making process follows tiered thresholds based on significance: routine decisions require a simple majority (4/7), technical standards need a supermajority (5/7), and major policy changes demand a supermajority plus a public comment period, ensuring the community has a voice in significant ecosystem changes.

The framework implements a four-layer smart contract system to provide verifiable performance metrics, inspired by the principle that transparency builds trust in decentralized systems.

The Service Provider Layer establishes standard contract interfaces for all providers, ensuring consistent implementation across the ecosystem with structured event emission for key metrics and consistent reporting functions that make performance data accessible and verifiable.

The Metrics Aggregation Layer handles collection and processing of performance data from multiple sources, calculates derived metrics to provide meaningful insights, and implements threshold-based attestation triggers that automatically flag potential issues before they impact users.

The Registry & Attestation Layer integrates with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), maintains an immutable provider registry with tiered classifications based on capability and reliability, and creates a verifiable performance history allowing users to make informed decisions based on actual data.

The Governance Layer enables parameter management and system configuration controlled by the SPAB, provides manual attestation capabilities for special cases requiring human judgment, and implements multi-signature security for critical functions to prevent single-entity compromise.

Drawing from Perama's research, the framework establishes standards for gateway protocols facilitating L2/L1 communication, proof verification mechanisms ensuring data integrity across chains, message passing requirements with standardized formats and validation, and state commitment verification to maintain consistency across different environments.

Inspired by the Mass HIway ENS Vendor Certification model, the accreditation process includes comprehensive steps ensuring only qualified providers receive the ENS stamp of approval.

The Application & Initial Review phase requires detailed documentation submission outlining technical approach and security measures, technical architecture assessment against established best practices, and security practices evaluation to identify potential vulnerabilities early.

The Technical Assessment involves code review against standards by qualified auditors, security audit focusing on ENS-specific threat vectors, performance testing under various load conditions, and interoperability validation with existing ENS infrastructure.

On-Chain Integration includes metrics reporting implementation to ensure transparency, attestation generation creating an immutable record of compliance, and registry inclusion making the provider discoverable to users.

Continuous Monitoring ensures regular performance reviews against established benchmarks, security incident response assessment to ensure preparedness, and compliance verification with evolving standards.


For ENS DAO, the framework enhances protocol reputation through quality assurance of service providers, enables ecosystem expansion through standardized implementations lowering barriers to entry, creates new revenue streams through accreditation fees contributing to DAO sustainability, and facilitates data-driven protocol improvement decisions based on real-world implementation metrics.

Service Providers benefit from official accreditation enhancing market credibility and user trust, access to technical expertise and implementation guidance from industry leaders, marketing exposure through the official registry increasing visibility, and reduced support costs through standardization of common functions.

End Users gain quality assurance for ENS-integrated services reducing the risk of poor experiences, transparent metrics for informed service selection based on actual performance, enhanced security through standardized implementations protecting digital identities, and consistent experience across providers regardless of which service they choose.

 5. Financial Model

 Initial Funding: 415,000 USD equivalent for 24 months
This funding level reflects the understanding that building robust infrastructure requires adequate resources while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

The Path to Sustainability includes tiered accreditation fees scaled to provider size ensuring accessibility for startups while capturing appropriate value from established players, subdomain registration revenue sharing for qualified providers, educational program fees for specialized training and certification, and grant funding for specific initiatives that advance the state of the art in ENS implementation.

The Budget Allocation covers core team salaries (Program Director, Technical Lead, etc.) to ensure dedicated expertise, technical infrastructure development and maintenance for the attestation system, security audits and assessments of both the framework and provider implementations, and educational resources and community outreach to build awareness and adoption of standards.

 Key Challenges Identified

 Scope Definition Ambiguity
- "At times I've seen some confusion and disagreement around the purpose of the service provider program." - nick.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "Nick's framework is significantly more specific and narrow than the official terms approved by the DAO." - brantlymillegan, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Resource Allocation & Duplication
- "Last year we had several providers, all individually credible, who were proposing to build essentially the same thing." - nick.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "Unfortunately, due to the nature of ranked choice voting, even with best intentions all around the DAO may end up appointing multiple parties to do the same thing." - nick.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Value Measurement
- "I'd be intrigued to see alternate measures of 'success' like 'How many are used as primary names'." - clowes.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "Are you suggesting we prioritize businesses that maximize profit? That doesn't seem to align with the ENS DAO's mission." - cap, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Accountability & Transparency
- "Unlike the later, who will presumably submit nominations with proposed budgets the returning applicants can give transparent and itemized breakdowns reflecting how their budget was allocated/spent, or not, in the first year." - ENSPunks.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "The DAO can't confirm alignment with Article III. This minimizes risks of misallocation and could be helpful to delegates concerning themselves with 'duplicates'." - ENSPunks.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Potential Solutions for SPAB Implementation

 Clear Categorization Framework
- "In my mind there are three broad categories: ENS infrastructure, Outreach and integrations, DAO infrastructure." - nick.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "Perhaps posts like this could be collated in the new 'Service Provider' forum category. Perhaps a 'Delegate Viewpoints' section would be useful." - clowes.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Improved Selection Process
- "An alternative program that avoids this would look quite different - starting with the approval (by voting) of a set of RFPs, and then the election of a single provider for each RFP." - nick.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "It's best to have two teams competing on the same topic. This setup creates an environment where both teams are driven to deliver the best product as quickly as possible." - chomtana, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "We should look at how Optimism's governance grant has evolved for RFP and learn from how Solana accelerators fund new, high-potential teams." - chomtana, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- For a model of vendor certification process: "ENS vendors can apply with EOHHS to become Certified ENS Vendors for the purpose of participating in the Statewide ENS Framework." - Mass HIway ENS Vendor Certification

 Standardized Metrics & Reporting
- "EOHHS will use the quarterly reports to verify vendor compliance and performance, and track the effectiveness of the Statewide ENS Framework." - Mass HIway ENS Vendor Certification
- "For example, if multiple teams are working on the same thing, the deciding factor could reasonably come down to which team was more effective with SP stream in the first year." - ENSPunks.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum

 Balance Revenue-Generation with Ecosystem Growth
- "Our focus should be on developing ENS infrastructure that drives adoption and usage." - chomtana, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "Subnames are currently in my opinion the best and only way to horizontally scale and grow the ENS userbase and let people, communities, apps, companies, rollups, etc. run their own namespaces." - cap, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "As far as the Subname $$ value goes - I agree, they don't currently add $$ value to the DAO but if that's an issue, that can be changed." - cap, ENS DAO Governance Forum


- Reference on interconnection requirements: "To become certified, ENS vendors must agree to share incoming ADT alerts from Acute Care Hospitals with all other Certified ENS Vendors by interconnecting their ENS systems to exchange the alerts." - Mass HIway ENS Vendor Certification
- "Competition is good, it creates accountability and incentivises innovation. I think the first iteration of the program gives us data - teams x, and y did this, did they do it well? did it add value? do we need them both/all?" - clowes.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
- "The long and the short of my opinion is that all third party developer teams who provide value in excess of their cost to the DAO should be funded." - clowes.eth, ENS DAO Governance Forum
