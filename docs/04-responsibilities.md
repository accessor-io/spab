# Responsibilities of the Oversight Committee

## Development of Technical Standards

The committee will draft and maintain technical standards that define protocols for ENS integrations within the Ethereum ecosystem, including but not limited to:

- **Interface Specifications**: Defining APIs and SDKs that ensure consistent interactions with ENS smart contracts, including EIP-137 resolution and EIP-2304 metadata handling on Ethereum.

- **Data Handling Practices**: Guidelines for managing user data on Ethereum, ensuring privacy through zero-knowledge proofs where applicable, and complying with data protection regulations.

- **Security Protocols**: Mandatory security measures such as EIP-712 signature verification, multi-chain address resolution security, and incident response procedures within the Ethereum network.

- **Compatibility Requirements**: Ensuring compatibility across different platforms and devices to provide a seamless user experience, including Layer 2 solutions and cross-chain interoperability with Ethereum.

The standards will be developed in collaboration with service providers and the broader ENS community, undergoing public consultation phases before ratification through DAO governance on Ethereum.

## Accreditation Process

Accreditation will involve a rigorous evaluation of service providers based on the established standards. The process includes:

- **Application Submission**: Service providers submit detailed documentation demonstrating compliance with technical and operational standards, including Ethereum smart contract addresses and architecture diagrams.

- **Code Review**: Expert analysis of source code and Ethereum smart contracts to identify potential vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices, including EIP compliance verification.

- **Security Audits**: Independent security assessments conducted by third-party auditors approved by the committee, focusing on areas like cross-chain resolution and multi-signature implementations on Ethereum.

- **Operational Assessment**: Evaluation of service reliability, including testing of uptime, failover capabilities, and customer support responsiveness, particularly for cross-chain operations with Ethereum.

- **Compliance Verification**: Ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, particularly in jurisdictions where the service operates, including KYC/AML considerations for domain registration on Ethereum.

Upon successful completion, service providers receive an accreditation certificate, a public endorsement that signifies their commitment to excellence and compliance, recorded on-chain for transparency within the Ethereum network.

## Ongoing Monitoring and Compliance Enforcement

Accreditation is not a one-time event; it requires continuous compliance. The committee will:

- **Conduct Periodic Reviews**: Scheduled reassessments to verify ongoing adherence to standards, including Ethereum smart contract upgrades and new feature implementations.

- **Monitor Security Incidents**: Require immediate reporting of security breaches or significant incidents and oversee remediation efforts, particularly for cross-chain vulnerabilities within the Ethereum ecosystem.

- **Revocation Mechanisms**: In cases of non-compliance or malpractice, the committee reserves the right to suspend or revoke accreditation, following due process and providing opportunities for corrective action, with all decisions recorded on-chain on Ethereum.

## Facilitation of Collaboration and Community Engagement

The committee will organize forums, workshops, and collaborative projects to:

- **Encourage Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate the exchange of ideas, challenges, and solutions among service providers and developers, particularly in areas of Layer 2 integration and cross-chain interoperability with Ethereum.

- **Promote Best Practices**: Highlight exemplary implementations and innovative solutions that advance the ENS ecosystem, including novel uses of EIP standards and CCIP-Read implementations on Ethereum.

- **Gather Feedback**: Actively solicit input from users and service providers to inform ongoing improvements to standards and processes, using decentralized voting mechanisms on Ethereum for prioritization.

## Education and Outreach

To support the adoption and understanding of ENS within the Ethereum ecosystem, the committee will:

- **Develop Educational Resources**: Create documentation, tutorials, and guides for both technical and non-technical audiences, covering topics from basic ENS resolution to advanced cross-chain operations on Ethereum.

- **Host Training Programs**: Offer webinars, workshops, and certification courses for developers and service providers, focusing on EIP standards implementation and security best practices within the Ethereum network.

- **Engage with External Communities**: Participate in industry conferences, academic collaborations, and partnerships to promote ENS, particularly its cross-chain capabilities and Layer 2 integrations with Ethereum.
