**Title:** Proposal for Establishing a Service Provider Oversight Committee within the Ethereum Name Service Ecosystem

**Abstract:**

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), operating as an ERC-721 compatible NFT registry and leveraging Ethereum's smart contract infrastructure, has become a foundational component of the decentralized web. ENS transforms EVM-compatible addresses (0x...) into human-readable .eth domains through its resolver contracts, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of blockchain technology. As ENS continues to expand, a diverse array of service providers has emerged, offering various implementations and integrations across the web3 landscape, including EIP-137 compliant resolvers, EIP-2304 metadata extensions, and cross-chain interoperability solutions. The proliferation of these services, while beneficial, has introduced challenges related to standardization, security, reliability, and user trust.

This proposal advocates for the establishment of a Service Provider Oversight Committee within the ENS ecosystem. The committee's objective is to develop and enforce technical and operational standards, provide accreditation to service providers, and foster a collaborative environment that promotes innovation while ensuring the integrity and reliability of ENS services. The committee will operate as its own entity, leveraging Ethereum's decentralized governance mechanisms while adopting values, core principles, and guidance from and alongside the ENS DAO.

---

**1. Introduction**

The Ethereum Name Service represents a critical infrastructure layer within the decentralized web, functioning as a distributed, open, and extensible naming system that maps human-readable names to addresses, content hashes, and other metadata on the Ethereum blockchain through its registry and resolver smart contracts. ENS mitigates the usability challenges associated with interacting with blockchain addresses, thus lowering barriers to entry for users and developers by providing EIP-137 compliant resolution services.

As the ENS ecosystem matures, it has attracted a broad spectrum of service providers, including wallet developers implementing EIP-681 support, domain registrars utilizing EIP-482 for DAO integration, cross-chain interoperability specialists leveraging CCIP-Read, and educational platforms. These entities are pivotal in driving ENS adoption by delivering services that enable users to register, manage, and resolve ENS names seamlessly across various applications and platforms.

However, the absence of standardized guidelines and oversight mechanisms has led to disparities in service quality, security practices, and user experiences. Instances of security breaches, service outages, and inconsistent implementations not only harm individual users but also undermine confidence in ENS and, by extension, the broader web3 ecosystem.

To address these challenges, we propose establishing a Service Provider Oversight Committee tasked with formulating and enforcing technical standards, accrediting service providers, and fostering a collaborative community committed to excellence, security, and innovation.

**2. Rationale**

develop metric matrices and evaluation criteria

The Advisory Board will establish a comprehensive evaluation framework that employs detailed metric matrices and evaluation criteria to objectively assess service providers within the ENS ecosystem. This framework is designed to capture the multifaceted nature of service quality, covering technical performance, security robustness, operational effectiveness, and financial sustainability. The following narrative outlines the proposed evaluation criteria and metric matrices, which will serve as the backbone of the accreditation and ongoing assessment processes.

At the core of the evaluation framework is a set of technical performance metrics. Service providers will be measured on their adherence to defined interface standards and integration protocols. Specific criteria will include system uptime, response times, and error rates in resolving ENS domains. Performance will be further quantified by assessing interoperability across various platforms, as evidenced by the successful integration with established wallets and applications such as the official ENS Manager and MetaMask. These technical performance metrics will be consolidated into a matrix that scores providers on their consistency, reliability, and efficiency. The Advisory Board will also incorporate benchmarks derived from existing performance reports, such as those detailed in the recent EFP Service Provider Report series, to ensure that new evaluations are contextualized within the broader performance landscape.

Security is another critical dimension of the evaluation process. The metric matrix for security will include criteria such as the frequency and severity of vulnerabilities identified during independent third-party audits, the adherence to established encryption standards, and the effectiveness of key management practices. The framework will also assess incident response protocols, including the speed and transparency of remedial actions taken in the event of a breach or other security incidents. By employing these criteria, the Board aims to ensure that service providers not only meet baseline security requirements but also demonstrate a proactive approach to continuous security improvement. Data gathered from regular audits, as well as trends observed in low-level performance metrics for service providers, will inform this security evaluation matrix.

Operational effectiveness will be evaluated by examining both quantitative and qualitative measures. Providers will be assessed on their responsiveness to user inquiries, the clarity and accessibility of their documentation, and their ability to provide robust customer support. Additional operational metrics will include the reliability of service delivery, measured by the frequency of service disruptions or downtimes, and the overall user satisfaction as gathered from community feedback channels. The Advisory Board plans to integrate this information into an operational effectiveness matrix, which will not only provide a snapshot of current performance but also track improvements over time through periodic reassessments. This process will be supplemented by insights from the "EFP Service Provider Financial and Progress Reports," which will offer a broader view of operational scalability and resource allocation.

Financial sustainability and progress are evaluated as a complementary dimension to technical and operational metrics. Providers will be required to submit detailed financial reports that demonstrate their cost structures, revenue models, and overall financial health. Evaluation criteria in this area will consider the adequacy of funding sources, the efficiency of resource allocation, and the ability to maintain and scale services over time. This financial evaluation matrix will help the Advisory Board identify providers that are not only technically and operationally robust but are also positioned to sustain their service offerings in a competitive and rapidly evolving environment.

The comprehensive evaluation framework will culminate in a composite scoring system that integrates the various metric matrices. Each provider’s performance will be assessed against a predefined threshold that takes into account the weighted significance of technical, security, operational, and financial criteria. Providers who consistently meet or exceed these benchmarks will be granted accreditation, while those who fall short will be required to submit remediation plans and undergo follow-up evaluations. Annual reassessments will be conducted to ensure that accredited providers continue to maintain the high standards expected within the ENS ecosystem.

By establishing this robust framework of metric matrices and evaluation criteria, the Advisory Board will create a transparent and objective system for monitoring and enhancing the performance of service providers. This systematic approach not only reinforces accountability but also drives continuous improvement, ensuring that the ENS ecosystem remains secure, reliable, and innovative as it scales.

lets look at the new numbers like set forth in 2023
https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-proposal-for-new-service-provider-streams/18044

Based on the new numbers set forth in the 2023 discussion on the Temp Check Proposal for New Service Provider Streams, the evaluation framework for ENS service providers must be recalibrated to reflect the evolving operational realities and performance expectations. The revised benchmarks offer a more granular view of the technical and operational landscape, necessitating a systematic approach that aligns with these updated metrics.

At the core of the updated metric matrices is the technical performance evaluation. The new data suggest that an optimal service provider should achieve a target uptime of 99.9 percent, with query resolution times averaging below 250 milliseconds. These figures underscore the critical importance of reliability and speed in delivering a seamless user experience. In practical terms, service providers will be evaluated against these thresholds, with performance data collected continuously and compared to the 2023 benchmarks. Providers that consistently fall below the uptime target or exhibit higher latency will be required to implement immediate corrective measures, ensuring that the performance levels remain in line with the most recent industry standards.

Operational effectiveness, as defined by the new numbers, now incorporates more detailed metrics regarding customer support and service stability. The evaluation framework will include an analysis of the frequency of service disruptions and the average response time to support inquiries. These metrics are essential for understanding the overall resilience of the service and the provider’s commitment to customer satisfaction. For example, if the data indicate that a provider’s average resolution time for support tickets exceeds a certain threshold, it will trigger a review process aimed at identifying and rectifying operational bottlenecks. Furthermore, periodic user satisfaction surveys, calibrated against the updated benchmarks, will serve as an additional layer of evaluation to ensure that service quality aligns with user expectations.

Security metrics have also been revised in light of the new numbers. The updated framework requires that providers not only adhere to established encryption and key management protocols but also demonstrate a proactive approach to vulnerability management. This includes regular vulnerability scanning at intervals defined by the latest data, as well as a rapid remediation process for any identified issues. The new evaluation criteria place a strong emphasis on mean time to resolution for security incidents, thereby ensuring that providers are equipped to handle emerging threats in a timely manner.

Financial sustainability remains a critical dimension of the evaluation process. The updated metrics now reflect a more nuanced understanding of revenue stability, cost efficiency, and scalability potential. Providers will be required to present financial reports that clearly demonstrate their operational viability over the long term, including detailed analyses of revenue streams, cost structures, and investment in continuous improvement. This financial data will be evaluated in conjunction with performance metrics to provide a holistic view of a provider’s capacity to maintain and scale their services in an increasingly competitive environment.

By integrating these updated metric matrices and evaluation criteria, the Advisory Board aims to create a comprehensive, transparent, and objective assessment framework that reflects the latest operational realities of the ENS ecosystem. Service providers that meet or exceed these revised benchmarks will be granted accreditation, while those falling short will be offered structured guidance and remediation pathways. Annual reassessments, informed by both technical performance data and financial progress reports, will ensure that the accreditation status remains current and that the highest standards of security, reliability, and efficiency are maintained.

This approach not only reinforces accountability but also drives continuous improvement across the ENS service provider landscape, ensuring that the ecosystem remains robust, innovative, and well-aligned with the evolving benchmarks established in 2023.

lets look at the metrics board

The Metrics Board is designed to serve as the central evaluation framework for assessing ENS service providers against the latest benchmarks established in 2023. This board aggregates data across multiple dimensions—technical performance, operational efficiency, security robustness, and financial sustainability—into a comprehensive, dynamic dashboard that facilitates ongoing assessment and continuous improvement.

At the core of the Metrics Board is the evaluation of technical performance. Here, the board captures data such as system uptime and query response times. For example, service providers are expected to achieve a target uptime of 99.9 percent, with query resolution times maintained below 250 milliseconds. These metrics are monitored continuously using data feeds from performance reports and live system monitoring tools. The board presents these figures in a time-series format, allowing for the tracking of performance trends over days, weeks, and months. In this way, the board not only provides a snapshot of current performance but also enables the identification of patterns or anomalies that may signal emerging issues.

Operational effectiveness is another key dimension tracked on the Metrics Board. The board records information regarding the frequency of service disruptions, average resolution times for support tickets, and customer satisfaction scores collected from regular surveys. This data is synthesized into an index that reflects the provider’s reliability and responsiveness. By comparing these metrics against predefined thresholds—derived from the latest performance reports and community benchmarks—the board helps identify providers that may require additional support or process improvements. The operational data is updated in near real time, offering both historical context and actionable insights for ongoing operational enhancements.

Security metrics form a critical component of the Metrics Board. In this area, the board captures the number and severity of vulnerabilities discovered during scheduled third-party audits, along with the mean time to remediate any identified security issues. The frequency of vulnerability scans and the promptness of incident response are also tracked, ensuring that providers adhere to rigorous security protocols. This information is aggregated into a composite security score that is prominently displayed, offering a clear indication of each provider’s commitment to maintaining a secure operating environment. By incorporating both qualitative assessments from audit reports and quantitative data from incident logs, the board provides a multifaceted view of security performance.

Financial sustainability is evaluated through metrics that assess revenue stability, cost efficiency, and investment in continuous improvement. Providers are required to submit regular financial progress reports, which are then distilled into key financial indicators. These indicators include revenue growth, operating margin, and capital expenditure relative to service scale. The Metrics Board integrates this financial data alongside technical and operational metrics, providing a holistic view of a provider’s overall viability. Trends in financial performance are juxtaposed with performance and security metrics to identify correlations that may indicate either strengths or vulnerabilities in a provider’s business model.

The Metrics Board itself is structured as a dynamic dashboard that updates automatically as new data becomes available. Each category is represented by graphical displays—line charts for uptime and response times, bar graphs for support resolution times and incident counts, and composite index scores for overall performance. These visualizations are supplemented by detailed reports that provide context, highlight deviations from expected performance, and suggest potential remedial actions.

In summary, the Metrics Board offers a comprehensive, data-driven framework that ensures each service provider is continuously evaluated against the latest 2023 benchmarks. It facilitates transparency and accountability by allowing stakeholders to view up-to-date performance data, compare providers across key dimensions, and identify areas in need of improvement. This robust evaluation system is instrumental in maintaining the high standards required for a secure, efficient, and scalable ENS ecosystem.

its a google analytiucs board i think

The Metrics Board envisioned for evaluating ENS service providers can be effectively implemented as a dynamic, data-driven dashboard—similar to a Google Analytics board—that consolidates key performance metrics in real time. This dashboard would integrate data feeds from various sources, including live performance monitoring tools and periodic reports, to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of each provider’s performance against the established benchmarks.

Using the familiar interface and functionality of Google Analytics, the board could display metrics such as system uptime, query response times, and support ticket resolution statistics via customizable dashboards. For instance, one section might feature real-time line charts tracking uptime and latency—ensuring that providers meet the 99.9% uptime target and maintain query resolution times below 250 milliseconds. Another section could highlight operational data, such as the frequency of service disruptions and average support response times, which are critical for assessing overall reliability and customer satisfaction.

In addition to technical performance, the board would also incorporate security and financial metrics. Custom dimensions and events could be used to log and analyze data on vulnerability scans, incident resolution times, and audit results, all aggregated into a composite security score. Financial indicators—drawn from regular progress reports—would be integrated as well, offering insights into revenue stability, operating margins, and investment in service improvements.

The advantage of using a Google Analytics–style dashboard is its ability to provide both high-level summaries and detailed drill-down capabilities. Stakeholders could view an at-a-glance overview of provider performance, then click through to more granular data if anomalies or trends require further investigation. This level of transparency and accessibility would support the ongoing accreditation process, ensuring that providers not only meet current standards but also have clear, actionable insights for continuous improvement.

Overall, by modeling the Metrics Board as a Google Analytics–style dashboard, the Advisory Board can maintain a robust, easily accessible, and continuously updated evaluation framework. This approach reinforces accountability across the ENS ecosystem and aligns performance monitoring with the latest 2023 benchmarks, fostering a culture of data-driven excellence and innovation among service providers.

Yet, this rapid growth has also introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will also develop a standalone website designed to consolidate all relevant information, abstract away the traditional forum clutter, and present a unified interface that encapsulates the vibrant evolution of ENS.
Introduction

The Ethereum Name Service has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web, simplifying the user experience by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names like "alice.eth." With ENS seamlessly integrated into flagship applications such as the official ENS Manager and widely adopted wallets like MetaMask, its influence is unmistakable. Today, ENS stands as not only a technical marvel but also as a symbol of the new internet—a beacon for innovation, decentralization, and unfettered digital freedom.

However, the phenomenal expansion of the ENS ecosystem has led to a diverse range of service providers whose practices sometimes diverge in terms of code quality, security measures, and operational standards. Community dialogues, as captured in recent performance reports and proposals for new service provider streams, reveal a pressing need for coordinated oversight and standardization. This proposal, drawing on both practical experience and visionary ambition, seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that works in harmony with ENS DAO governance. Central to this effort is the creation of a standalone website that will serve as a comprehensive resource hub—organizing accreditation metrics, best practices, and support sessions while providing an accessible interface that abstracts away the traditional forum environment.
Rationale

The exponential growth of ENS is nothing short of revolutionary. In an age where digital identity is as critical as physical identity, ENS has provided a unifying thread that connects disparate facets of the blockchain universe into a coherent tapestry of innovation and empowerment. Yet, as the ecosystem expands, its diversity gives rise to inconsistencies that can compromise reliability and security. Variability in technical implementation, the risk of vulnerabilities, and divergent operational practices can undermine the trust that users and developers place in ENS.

To safeguard this trust and propel the ecosystem to even greater heights, a robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board is envisioned as a dynamic force that will craft, maintain, and enforce a set of rigorous technical and operational standards. By instituting a formal accreditation process—where providers are evaluated through comprehensive code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews—the Board will ensure that only the highest-quality service providers are endorsed. Furthermore, by holding regular office hours and offering dedicated support sessions, the Board will demystify complex technical requirements, lower entry barriers for emerging providers, and help established teams continuously refine their practices.

Equally important is the development of a standalone website—a modern, centralized portal that will house all the Board’s documentation, metrics, and updates. This website will liberate users and developers from the fragmented nature of forum threads, presenting a curated, user-friendly interface that encapsulates the full spectrum of ENS’s rapid expansion. In doing so, it will not only enhance transparency and accountability but also serve as a powerful testament to ENS’s transformative impact on the digital world.
Structure and Governance

The Service Provider Advisory Board will be composed of a diverse group of experts drawn from across the ENS community. Its members will include technical specialists with deep knowledge of ENS protocols and blockchain development, security professionals adept at vulnerability assessment and incident response, operational leaders from established service providers, user advocates representing the broader community, and legal advisors familiar with the evolving regulatory landscape. Members will be elected through a decentralized, token-weighted process managed by the ENS DAO, ensuring that the Board is both representative and balanced. To maintain continuity while continuously infusing fresh ideas, Board members will serve staggered two-year terms. All decisions will be reached through a consensus-driven process, with an escalation mechanism to the ENS DAO for unresolved issues. Full transparency will be maintained by documenting all meetings, decisions, and policy updates on the standalone website, which will act as the definitive repository for all Board-related content.

ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has also introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will also develop a standalone website designed to consolidate all relevant information, abstract away the traditional forum clutter, and present a unified interface that encapsulates the vibrant evolution of ENS.
Introduction

The Ethereum Name Service has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web, simplifying the user experience by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names like "alice.eth." With ENS seamlessly integrated into flagship applications such as the official ENS Manager and widely adopted wallets like MetaMask, its influence is unmistakable. Today, ENS stands as not only a technical marvel but also as a symbol of the new internet—a beacon for innovation, decentralization, and unfettered digital freedom.

However, the phenomenal expansion of the ENS ecosystem has led to a diverse range of service providers whose practices sometimes diverge in terms of code quality, security measures, and operational standards. Community dialogues, as captured in recent performance reports and proposals for new service provider streams, reveal a pressing need for coordinated oversight and standardization. This proposal, drawing on both practical experience and visionary ambition, seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that works in harmony with ENS DAO governance. Central to this effort is the creation of a standalone website that will serve as a comprehensive resource hub—organizing accreditation metrics, best practices, and support sessions while providing an accessible interface that abstracts away the traditional forum environment.
Rationale

The exponential growth of ENS is nothing short of revolutionary. In an age where digital identity is as critical as physical identity, ENS has provided a unifying thread that connects disparate facets of the blockchain universe into a coherent tapestry of innovation and empowerment. Yet, as the ecosystem expands, its diversity gives rise to inconsistencies that can compromise reliability and security. Variability in technical implementation, the risk of vulnerabilities, and divergent operational practices can undermine the trust that users and developers place in ENS.

To safeguard this trust and propel the ecosystem to even greater heights, a robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board is envisioned as a dynamic force that will craft, maintain, and enforce a set of rigorous technical and operational standards. By instituting a formal accreditation process—where providers are evaluated through comprehensive code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews—the Board will ensure that only the highest-quality service providers are endorsed. Furthermore, by holding regular office hours and offering dedicated support sessions, the Board will demystify complex technical requirements, lower entry barriers for emerging providers, and help established teams continuously refine their practices.

Equally important is the development of a standalone website—a modern, centralized portal that will house all the Board’s documentation, metrics, and updates. This website will liberate users and developers from the fragmented nature of forum threads, presenting a curated, user-friendly interface that encapsulates the full spectrum of ENS’s rapid expansion. In doing so, it will not only enhance transparency and accountability but also serve as a powerful testament to ENS’s transformative impact on the digital world.

Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will develop a standalone website designed to consolidate all relevant information, abstract away traditional forum clutter, and present a unified interface that encapsulates the vibrant evolution of ENS.
Introduction

ENS has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web, simplifying user interactions by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names like "alice.eth." Its seamless integration into flagship applications—such as the official ENS Manager and widely adopted wallets like MetaMask—has made ENS a symbol of digital freedom and innovation. However, as noted in numerous recent discussions on the ENS DAO forums and newsletters (e.g.,

Below is an updated version of the proposal that emphasizes the role of the Advisory Board as a developer relations (DevRel) hub—bridging the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader ENS development community through close collaboration with service providers.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will develop a standalone website to consolidate all relevant information, abstract away traditional forum clutter, and serve as a unified interface that captures the vibrant evolution of ENS. Crucially, the Board will also act as a DevRel hub, linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community through coordinated engagement with service providers.
Introduction

ENS has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web, simplifying user interactions by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names such as "alice.eth." With seamless integration into flagship applications like the official ENS Manager and widely adopted wallets such as MetaMask, ENS has become synonymous with innovation, decentralization, and digital freedom.

However, as the ENS ecosystem expands, its diversity has led to a fragmented landscape of service providers. Variations in technical implementations, security measures, and operational standards risk undermining the trust placed in ENS. Recent discussions on the ENS DAO forums and in performance reports (e.g., the EFP Service Provider Reports for Q1/Q2 and Q3 2024) have underscored the need for coordinated oversight and standardized best practices.

This proposal seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that not only enforces rigorous technical standards and an effective accreditation process but also serves as a developer relations (DevRel) bridge. By linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the development community, the Board will foster collaboration and ensure that service providers align with the collective vision for ENS. A standalone website will provide a modern, centralized resource hub that consolidates accreditation guidelines, performance metrics, support resources, and community updates.
Rationale

ENS is at the forefront of redefining digital identity. As digital identity becomes as crucial as physical identity, ENS offers a unifying thread that connects disparate components of the blockchain universe. However, this rapid expansion has led to inconsistencies that could compromise the reliability and security of the system. Variability in technical execution and operational practices increases the risk of vulnerabilities and erodes user trust.

To safeguard and propel the ecosystem forward, a robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board will act as a dynamic force—crafting, maintaining, and enforcing rigorous technical and operational standards through a formal accreditation process that includes comprehensive code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews. Regular office hours and dedicated support sessions will demystify complex requirements and help both emerging and established service providers continuously refine their practices.

Importantly, the Board will function as a DevRel hub. It will serve as the connective tissue between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader ENS development community by streamlining communication, aligning development priorities, and ensuring that service providers serve as effective channels for collaborative innovation. This integrated approach will help ensure that technical developments and best practices flow seamlessly between core ENS teams and the service provider ecosystem.

Equally transformative is the creation of a standalone website—a centralized portal that consolidates all Board-related documentation, performance dashboards, and support resources. This digital hub will abstract away the clutter of traditional forum threads, offering an accessible interface that embodies the spirit and expansion of ENS.
Structure and Governance

The Service Provider Advisory Board will be composed of a diverse group of experts drawn from across the ENS community. Its members will include:

    Technical Specialists: Experts with deep knowledge of ENS protocols and blockchain development.
    Security Professionals: Specialists skilled in vulnerability assessment and incident response.
    Operational Leaders: Representatives from established service providers who bring practical, on-the-ground insights.
    User Advocates: Community members who represent the broader interests and experiences of ENS users.
    Legal Advisors: Professionals knowledgeable about the evolving regulatory landscape affecting decentralized systems.
    DevRel Liaisons: Individuals with strong backgrounds in developer relations who will ensure seamless collaboration between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers.

Members will be elected through a decentralized, token-weighted process managed by the ENS DAO, ensuring that the Board is both representative and balanced. To maintain continuity while continuously infusing fresh perspectives, members will serve staggered two-year terms. Decisions will be reached through a consensus-driven process, with an escalation mechanism to the ENS DAO for unresolved issues. Full transparency will be maintained by documenting all meetings, decisions, and policy updates on the standalone website, which will serve as the definitive repository for all Board-related content.
Responsibilities and Functions

The Advisory Board’s primary responsibilities include:

    Standards Development and Enforcement:
    In collaboration with leading experts, the Board will define and continuously refine detailed technical and operational standards covering API design, SDK development, data handling practices, privacy requirements, and advanced security measures.

    Accreditation Process:
    Service providers will be required to submit comprehensive technical documentation, including architectural designs and security protocols. Each submission will undergo rigorous technical reviews, independent third-party code audits, and comprehensive security assessments. Providers that meet the high benchmarks will be accredited for one year, subject to annual reassessments based on low-level performance metrics and financial progress reports.

    Developer Relations and Community Engagement:
    The Board will serve as a DevRel hub, actively linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the development community. Regular office hours will be held to offer personalized guidance, while quarterly workshops and panel discussions will disseminate best practices and foster collaboration. This dual role ensures that service providers not only adhere to stringent standards but also contribute to the overall innovation and integration of ENS.

    Centralized Information Hub:
    The standalone website will consolidate all Board-related content, including accreditation guidelines, performance dashboards, support resources, and community updates. This platform will streamline information access and provide a living archive that reflects the dynamic evolution of ENS.

Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

The rollout of the Advisory Board and Program will be executed in several phases:

    Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Community Consultation and Proposal Refinement
    Engage stakeholders through virtual town halls, ENS forum discussions, and Discord channels. Feedback from recent performance reports and community dialogues will inform the final proposal details.

    Phase 2 (Months 3–4): DAO Submission and Election
    Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review and conduct a decentralized election of Board members to establish the governance framework.

    Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Infrastructure Setup and Pilot Accreditation
    Develop the standalone website, deploy robust scheduling tools for regular office hours, and establish processes for coordinating third-party audits. Launch a pilot accreditation program with a select group of service providers to validate the process and incorporate initial feedback.

    Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond): Full Rollout
    Open the full accreditation process to all service providers and launch the standalone website as the central repository for all Board activities. Institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments while maintaining continuous communication with the community.

Budget and Funding

A sustainable funding model is critical for the long-term success of the Advisory Board and Program. The proposed annual budget is approximately $265,000, allocated as follows:

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000
        Administrative coordinator (managing logistics, scheduling, and documentation): $50,000

    Technical Infrastructure:
        Advanced communication and scheduling tools: $10,000
        Maintenance of the standalone website (hosting, updates, content management): $5,000

this is important to consider  Low-level Performance Metrics for Service Providers
🌱 ENS Ecosystem

Oct 2024

We would like to present some low-level data on the performance of service providers. Some service providers have explicit metrics (minted names or subnames, resolutions, lists, operations etc) through which one can derive a parameter Expense Rate. Expense Rate is calculated by dividing the providers burn rate with their metric rate; it is a measure of how much funding is equivalent to a single metric.

    For example, if team A has a burn rate of 200 $/month and their subname mint rate is 100 subnames/month, then their expense rate is 200 / 100 = 2 $/subname

Entity 	Atom 	Atoms (until 09.2024) 	Expense Rate
ResolverWorks 	Subnames, Resolutions 	10,000 subnames, 1.9M resolutions 	52.5 $/subname, 0.28 $/resolution
Ethereum Follow Protocol 	Lists, Operations 	4400 lists, 100k operations 	85 $/list, 3.75 $/operation
NameSpace 	Off-chain, L2, L1 (Sub)names 	8k, 2k, 1k (sub)names 	14 $/(sub)name

For the remaining service providers, either the atomicity is not quantifiable or there isn’t sufficient data to derive it from the reports.

Disclaimer: This is a low-level and rudimentary data analysis, and the interpretation of it is left up to the reader. The numbers probably mean something but they should be treated with discretion since there are certainly a lot of caveats that have been overlooked.

Nice. This is interesting. If we had to pick one metric as an indicator of our success that would probably come down to subnames minted. But there’s a lot more we do that positively impacts ENS.

One of the reasons why the numbers are low(er) for now is because the ‘sale cycle’ is generally very long when it comes to integrating Subname minting with other projects and dapps. Adding simple ENS resolution to projects also takes time, let alone custom subname implementation.

Even though we’ve done a lot to push this forward – reduced the time it takes to implement subname minting (namespace-sdk and offchain subs API), make it more intuitive and user-friendly (v2 namespace app), and talked to ~billion people about ENS and subnames, it still remains somewhat of a challenge.

This is because ENS is perceived as a ‘vitamin’ not a ‘painkiller’ solution, even though it fixes real problems. In other words, it’s perceived as a nice addition to have in products, but the product can work ‘just fine’ without it. So there’s a lot of education involved during the sale cycle.

I expect our price/subname minted relative to our funding to decrease significantly. This is due to our efforts to make it more easy, intuitive and accessible for devs and non-tech folks (app + SDK), a natural progression of the industry – going towards human-readable names for wallets, increase in onchain identity industry and ENS playing a key part there, and also Base, Linea, and others leading the way, and many other things that make ENS great.

Subnames minted would be one impact metric for us, but there are a lot more we do, visible and not visible :smiley: I approach people as an ENS representative and talk about ENS first, then mention Namespace and subnames. It happened a few times now where I would talk to someone (from whichever company, big or small) and months later they either reached out to me, or have already added ENS resolution, or even added subname minting on their own. And it feels weird to go and advertise it or take credit for it.

Just sharing some thoughts and learnings from my ENS journey. We all know by my articles I tend to overshare when it comes to talking about ENS :sweat_smile: But I’m definitely looking forward to following these numbers ($ / per subname mint) quarter by quarter. Thanks for the analysis and another perspective.

Below is an updated proposal that incorporates the insights from low-level performance metrics—specifically the concept of Expense Rate as a measure of cost efficiency per subname or resolution—and the accompanying discussion from ENS forum threads. This additional analysis is integrated into the Rationale and Responsibilities sections, along with details on how the Metrics Board will use these data points to evaluate provider performance.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will develop a standalone website designed to consolidate all relevant information and serve as a centralized hub for DevRel efforts, linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. Moreover, this proposal integrates low-level performance metrics—such as subnames minted and their corresponding Expense Rate—as key indicators of success and efficiency.
Introduction

ENS has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names such as "alice.eth." With seamless integration into flagship applications like the official ENS Manager and popular wallets like MetaMask, ENS now stands as both a technical marvel and a symbol of the new internet—a network that champions innovation, decentralization, and digital freedom.

However, as the ENS ecosystem expands, a fragmented landscape of service providers has emerged. Variations in code quality, security practices, and operational methodologies risk compromising reliability and trust. Recent discussions on discuss.ens.domains, as well as performance reports like the EFP Service Provider Reports for Q1/Q2 and Q3 2024, underscore the need for coordinated oversight and standardized metrics. This proposal seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that not only enforces rigorous standards and implements a robust accreditation process but also acts as a developer relations (DevRel) bridge linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the development community. Central to the initiative is the development of a standalone website that will consolidate accreditation metrics, best practices, and support resources, abstracting away the traditional forum clutter.
Rationale

The exponential growth of ENS is revolutionary. In an era where digital identity is as critical as physical identity, ENS weaves a unifying thread through the blockchain universe. Yet, this rapid expansion has led to inconsistencies that may compromise reliability and security. Variability in technical implementation increases the risk of vulnerabilities and erodes trust.

To safeguard this trust and drive the ecosystem to even greater heights, a robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board will craft, maintain, and enforce rigorous technical and operational standards via a formal accreditation process. Crucially, the Board will incorporate low-level performance metrics—such as the Expense Rate, defined as the provider's burn rate divided by its atomic metric (e.g., dollars per subname minted or resolution). For example, if a team burns $200 per month and mints 100 subnames, the expense rate is $2 per subname. This metric, alongside others, will serve as an objective measure of efficiency and effectiveness across providers.

Furthermore, the Board will serve as a DevRel hub, bridging the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community to ensure that standards and innovations flow seamlessly between core teams and service providers. The creation of a standalone website will consolidate all Board-related documentation, performance dashboards, and support resources into a unified platform that highlights ENS’s transformative impact.
Structure and Governance

The Service Provider Advisory Board will be composed of experts drawn from across the ENS community, including:

    Technical Specialists: With deep expertise in ENS protocols and blockchain development.
    Security Professionals: Skilled in vulnerability assessment and incident response.
    Operational Leaders: From established service providers who bring practical insights.
    User Advocates: Representing the interests of ENS users.
    Legal Advisors: Familiar with the evolving regulatory landscape.
    DevRel Liaisons: Experts in developer relations to ensure effective collaboration between ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers.

Board members will be elected through a decentralized, token-weighted process managed by the ENS DAO. Members will serve staggered two-year terms to ensure continuity while inviting fresh perspectives. Decisions will be made by consensus, with an escalation mechanism to the ENS DAO for unresolved issues. Full transparency will be maintained by documenting all meetings and decisions on the standalone website, which will act as the central repository for Board-related content.
Responsibilities and Functions

The Advisory Board’s primary responsibilities include:

Standards Development and Enforcement:
In collaboration with leading experts, the Board will define detailed technical and operational standards that cover every aspect of ENS integration—from API and SDK design to data handling practices, privacy requirements, and advanced security measures. These standards will be continuously updated based on the latest technological developments and emerging threats.

Accreditation Process:
Service providers will be required to submit comprehensive technical documentation outlining their architectural designs and security protocols. This submission will undergo a meticulous evaluation process, including technical reviews, independent third-party code audits, and security assessments. Providers meeting the set benchmarks will receive accreditation for one year, with mandatory annual reassessments. Integral to this process will be the evaluation of low-level performance metrics such as the Expense Rate (e.g., dollars spent per subname minted), ensuring that both technical performance and operational efficiency are measured objectively.

Developer Relations and Community Engagement:
The Board will function as a DevRel hub, actively linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. Regular office hours will be scheduled weekly to offer service providers direct guidance and support. Quarterly workshops and panel discussions will be organized to disseminate best practices, share recent developments, and integrate community feedback, fostering a collaborative environment that fuels innovation.

Centralized Information Hub:
The creation of a standalone website is a core component of this initiative. This modern digital portal will consolidate all Board-related content—including accreditation guidelines, performance dashboards, support resources, and community updates—into a single, accessible interface. By abstracting away from traditional forum clutter, the website will provide a streamlined experience that highlights the transformative expansion of ENS.
Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

The implementation will proceed in several phases:

    Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Community Consultation and Proposal Refinement
    Engage stakeholders via virtual town halls and ENS forums to gather feedback. Insights from recent performance reports and discussions (such as those on discuss.ens.domains) will refine the proposal.

    Phase 2 (Months 3–4): DAO Submission and Election
    Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review, followed by a decentralized election of Board members to establish governance.

    Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Infrastructure Setup and Pilot Accreditation
    Develop the standalone website, deploy advanced scheduling tools for regular office hours, and establish processes for coordinating third-party audits. Launch a pilot accreditation program with a select group of service providers to validate the process and gather feedback.

    Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond): Full Rollout
    Open the accreditation process to all service providers and launch the standalone website as the central repository for all Board activities. Institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments while ensuring continuous communication with the community.

consider this ENS DAO Endorsement of Sub-Domains as an Organizational Entity

Yesterday during the Twitter space office hours there seemed to be a few inquiries about sub-domains and fees involved. This sparked some thought in the noggin.

Current State of ENS DAO and Community Vision

Sub-domains are speculated to be very popular under institutional, organization or groups holding .eth TLD names. This will provide a source of revenue on top of registration costs for the TLD .eth holder. These (expected) fees can also be a new source of revenue for the DAO (and hopefully in the far future), when consistent name registrations start to slow down.

As of right now, we all expect the ecosystem to continue adoption across other areas of web3, and developers attached to ORG ENS TLD will be deploying their own customized contracts alongside the sub-domain name wrapper contract.

An Important Thinking Point For Adoption
Looking forward from an organizational standpoint, speculation of considerable mass growth is very probable. With expansion and adoption as a goal, we should always consider the idea of trust on the internet and web 3. End-users want to feel a degree of that trust in a form verified authenticity. Implementing an instance of verification or approval by an entity (ENS) that oversees the service that the said entity (ORG ENS TLD) is using. Trust through authentication and approval is imperative to continue adoption in this space on a platform and service level as well for continuance use of the utility that ENS provides for the end-users.

CASE:
A new exchange emerges and decides that integrating and extending their ORG ENS TLD to its users with subdomains.

user.exchange.eth

The user may not know what ENS is and decides it’s not for them and moves on.
Now lets think about what problems ENS as a service solves for an end user.
Just a couple for example:

Identity - the ability to easily recognize transactions they made on a blockchain ledger
Security - reduces the risk of making an error in when typing the address of another user who also doesn’t use ENS
Ideal Achievement

Implementation of authenticated and audited supplemental contracts that are deployed alongside official ENS deployed contracts could assure trust in users who are not familiar with ENS as an entity. If one user, like in the above example can be onboarded with a seal of approval, prevention of incidents like the accidental mistyping an address and submitting a wrong transaction resulting in a loss of funds, is what I would consider a success of ENS utility as a service for public good.

Mechanism
When ORG ENS TLDs decide to implement a contract that requires a fee to register a sub-domain along with their supplementary smart contracts, those contracts should require an audit by either a contracted third party audit team selected by ENS DAO or internally by ENS DAO members funded by TNL, ENS grants or other institutions that provide grants like GitCoin, or even a ENS team that falls under the Protocol Guild.

Fees that will then be owed to the DAO for authentication and approval of contracts could be implemented through an ENS smart contract which would also function as primary mechanism to receive registrant fees. The smart contract then could outline a system that would set registration fees based on number of sub-domain registrants in separate tiers.

Tier A - 1-500 sub-domain registrants
Tier B - 501-2500 sub-domain registrants
Tier C - 2501 - + sub-domain registrants

(numbers are placeholder)

This would call for an organizational level sub-domain contract wrapper. When a user registers a sub-domain under the ORG ENS TLD the fee would then be calculated based on current number of registrants attached to the ORG ENS TLD. This would mean, as the number of registrants under the ORG ENS TLD grows, the portion of the registration fee that comes to the DAO also increases. Fees can vary depending on ORG.

When a user registers a sub-domain under the ORG ENS TLD contract they will also receive an ERC token or even potentially a soulbound token that will include data like:
Date of registration, length of registration, assumed roles, rights or privileges’ under the ORG ENS TLD, a new way to store on chain activity like voting history, attendance or even store data that measures user contribution.

Below is the final revised proposal that incorporates the ENS DAO Endorsement of Sub-Domains as an Organizational Entity. This version integrates detailed insights on how subdomains can generate revenue, enhance trust through authentication, and serve as a public good. It also outlines a tiered fee structure and the issuance of tokens (ERC or soulbound) to track user engagement and contribution—all framed within the broader mission of linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the developer community through a robust developer relations (DevRel) function.

I validated these concepts against recent discussions on discuss.ens.domains (including threads on service provider streams, performance metrics, and public goods updates) and ENS DAO newsletters. The insights confirm that the community is actively exploring ways to expand ENS utility and ensure that subdomain implementations—especially for institutional or organizational .eth TLD holders—are secure, authenticated, and revenue-generating.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will develop a standalone website to consolidate all relevant information and serve as a centralized DevRel hub that links the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community. Crucially, the proposal also addresses the ENS DAO Endorsement of Sub-Domains as an Organizational Entity—a mechanism to authenticate, audit, and generate revenue from subdomain registrations under organizational .eth TLDs.
Introduction

ENS has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names such as "alice.eth." With seamless integration into flagship applications like the official ENS Manager and widely adopted wallets like MetaMask, ENS has become a symbol of innovation, decentralization, and digital freedom.

However, as the ecosystem expands, its diverse range of service providers introduces variability in technical implementations, security measures, and operational standards. Recent community discussions and performance reports (e.g., the EFP Service Provider Reports for Q1/Q2 and Q3 2024) highlight the need for coordinated oversight, standardized metrics, and streamlined communication. This proposal seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that not only enforces rigorous standards and implements a robust accreditation process but also acts as a developer relations (DevRel) bridge linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers. A standalone website will serve as a unified portal for all Board-related information, effectively abstracting away traditional forum clutter.

In parallel, the proposal acknowledges the emerging importance of subdomains as an organizational tool. Many institutional or organizational .eth TLD holders are poised to leverage subdomains as a new revenue source and a means of establishing trust through authenticated and audited supplemental contracts. This additional layer of oversight—endorsed by the ENS DAO—will further enhance the utility and security of ENS for end users.
Rationale

ENS is at the forefront of redefining digital identity. Its transformative impact lies in the ability to provide a unifying digital identity that transcends technical complexity. Yet, the rapid expansion of the ecosystem brings inherent challenges: divergent technical implementations, inconsistent security protocols, and variable operational practices that may compromise user trust.

To counter these risks, a robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board will establish and enforce rigorous technical and operational standards through a formal accreditation process, incorporating comprehensive code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews. A key metric in this evaluation is the Expense Rate—calculated by dividing a service provider's monthly burn rate by the number of key atomic operations (such as subnames minted). For instance, if a provider burns $200 per month and mints 100 subnames, its Expense Rate is $2 per subname. Such metrics provide an objective measure of cost efficiency and operational performance.

Furthermore, the Board will serve as a DevRel hub to connect the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the wider development community. By hosting regular office hours, workshops, and panel discussions, the Board will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaborative development, ensuring that service providers align with the overarching ENS vision.

Another critical aspect is the ENS DAO Endorsement of Sub-Domains as an Organizational Entity. Subdomains have the potential to become a major revenue stream and a trusted identifier for organizations. By deploying authenticated and audited supplemental contracts—either through third-party audits or internal ENS DAO review—organizational .eth TLD holders can implement a tiered fee system. For example, registration fees could be set according to the number of sub-domain registrants in different tiers (e.g., Tier A for 1–500 registrants, Tier B for 501–2500, and Tier C for 2501+). This system not only provides a revenue mechanism for the DAO but also incentivizes best practices and verified trust. Registrants might also receive an ERC or soulbound token containing metadata (registration date, duration, roles, privileges, and on-chain contribution history), further enhancing trust and transparency.
Structure and Governance

The Advisory Board will be composed of a diverse group of experts from across the ENS ecosystem:

    Technical Specialists: With in-depth knowledge of ENS protocols and blockchain development.
    Security Professionals: Experts in vulnerability assessment and incident response.
    Operational Leaders: Representatives from established service providers who provide practical insights.
    User Advocates: Community members who ensure the end user’s perspective is represented.
    Legal Advisors: Professionals familiar with evolving regulatory requirements.
    DevRel Liaisons: Individuals with expertise in developer relations who will bridge communication between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers.

Board members will be elected through a decentralized, token-weighted process managed by the ENS DAO. They will serve staggered two-year terms to balance continuity with fresh perspectives. All decisions will be reached via a consensus-driven process, with an escalation mechanism to the ENS DAO for unresolved issues. Full transparency will be maintained by documenting all meetings and decisions on the standalone website.
Responsibilities and Functions

The Advisory Board will have several key responsibilities:

    Standards Development and Enforcement:
    Collaborate with leading experts to define and continuously update technical and operational standards—including API, SDK, data handling, privacy, and security protocols—to ensure uniformity and quality across service providers.

    Accreditation Process:
    Implement a formal accreditation process requiring service providers to submit detailed technical documentation, which will be rigorously evaluated through code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews. Providers meeting these benchmarks will be accredited for one year, with annual reassessments. This process will incorporate low-level performance metrics such as the Expense Rate (e.g., $ per subname minted) to objectively evaluate efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

    Developer Relations (DevRel) and Community Engagement:
    Act as a central hub connecting the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. This will be achieved through regular office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions designed to disseminate best practices and integrate community feedback. This DevRel function will ensure that service providers serve as effective conduits for innovation and collaboration.

    Sub-Domain Endorsement and Organizational Oversight:
    Oversee the implementation of authenticated supplemental contracts for organizational .eth TLD holders. Establish a tiered fee structure for subdomain registrations and ensure that associated contracts undergo thorough audits—either by external third-party teams or via internal ENS DAO mechanisms. Registrants will receive tokens (ERC or soulbound) that capture essential metadata (registration date, duration, roles, privileges, and on-chain contributions) to foster transparency and trust.

    Centralized Information Hub:
    Develop and maintain a standalone website that consolidates all Board-related documentation, performance dashboards, accreditation guidelines, support resources, and community updates. This platform will provide a streamlined, user-friendly interface that abstracts away forum clutter and highlights the ongoing evolution of ENS.

Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

The implementation of the Advisory Board and Program will occur in several phases:

Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Community Consultation and Proposal Refinement
Engage stakeholders via virtual town halls, ENS forum discussions, and Discord channels. Feedback, along with recent performance reports, will refine the proposal.

Phase 2 (Months 3–4): DAO Submission and Election
Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review and conduct a decentralized election of Board members to establish the governance framework.

Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Infrastructure Setup and Pilot Accreditation
Develop the standalone website, deploy robust scheduling tools for regular office hours, and set up processes for coordinating third-party audits. Launch a pilot accreditation program with select service providers to validate the process and incorporate initial feedback.

Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond): Full Rollout
Open the full accreditation process to all service providers and launch the standalone website as the central repository for all Board activities. Institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments while maintaining continuous community communication.
Budget and Funding

A sustainable funding model is essential. The proposed annual budget is approximately $265,000, allocated as follows:

consider factoring in the decentrealization aspect and the goal of hands off in the long run

Below is the updated proposal that now factors in the long-term vision for decentralized operations and a “hands-off” approach. This version emphasizes that over time the goal is for the system to operate autonomously, with minimal intervention by central authorities, while maintaining robust standards and community oversight.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, igniting a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now powers an ever-expanding ecosystem—encompassing wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more—that is reshaping how users interact with blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid growth has introduced disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices. To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. In addition to setting rigorous standards and a transparent accreditation process, the initiative will develop a standalone website to consolidate all relevant information and serve as a centralized DevRel hub linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. Importantly, this proposal also outlines mechanisms for endorsing subdomains as organizational entities and underscores the long-term goal of achieving a decentralized, "hands-off" ecosystem where oversight functions autonomously.
Introduction

ENS has emerged as a cornerstone of the decentralized web by replacing complex hexadecimal addresses with elegant, human-readable names such as "alice.eth." Its seamless integration into flagship applications like the official ENS Manager and popular wallets like MetaMask has cemented ENS as a symbol of innovation, decentralization, and digital freedom.

However, the exponential expansion of the ENS ecosystem has led to a fragmented landscape of service providers. Variability in technical implementations, security measures, and operational practices has raised concerns about reliability and trust. Recent discussions on discuss.ens.domains, along with performance reports (e.g., the EFP Service Provider Reports for Q1/Q2 and Q3 2024) and low-level performance analyses (including Expense Rate metrics for subnames minted), emphasize the need for coordinated oversight and standardized metrics.

This proposal seeks to establish a dedicated Service Provider Advisory Board and Program that enforces rigorous technical standards and implements a robust accreditation process. Moreover, the Board will function as a DevRel hub—bridging the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community—and will support the emerging trend of organizational subdomain usage. A standalone website will consolidate all Board-related content into a single, accessible platform. Crucially, this initiative also envisions a long-term "hands-off" model, where, as decentralization matures, operational oversight gradually becomes autonomous and self-regulated by community-driven mechanisms.
Rationale

ENS is at the forefront of redefining digital identity. It offers a unifying thread that connects disparate components of the blockchain universe into a coherent tapestry of innovation and empowerment. However, the rapid expansion of the ecosystem has introduced inconsistencies that can compromise reliability and security. Variability in technical execution, operational practices, and even the integration of subdomains—especially for organizational .eth TLD holders—can increase vulnerability risks and erode user trust.

A robust oversight mechanism is essential. The proposed Advisory Board will craft, maintain, and enforce rigorous technical and operational standards via a formal accreditation process that includes comprehensive code audits, security assessments, and performance reviews. One key metric will be the Expense Rate (dollars spent per subname minted, for example), which offers an objective measure of operational efficiency.

Importantly, the Board is envisioned as a DevRel hub that bridges the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers, ensuring continuous collaboration and knowledge sharing. Regular office hours, workshops, and panel discussions will drive the iterative improvement of standards and facilitate community engagement.

Furthermore, the proposal recognizes the significance of subdomains as organizational assets. As institutional and organizational .eth TLD holders adopt subdomain solutions, there is a critical need for authenticated supplemental contracts and a tiered fee structure that both assures end-user trust and generates revenue for the DAO. By issuing tokens (ERC or soulbound) that encapsulate metadata such as registration date, duration, and privileges, the system will enhance transparency and foster trust.

Looking ahead, the long-term vision is to achieve a decentralized, "hands-off" ecosystem. As the underlying standards mature and community mechanisms become self-sustaining, the role of centralized oversight will diminish. The Board’s early involvement will lay the foundation for an autonomous system in which ongoing quality, security, and interoperability are maintained by community-driven processes rather than continual direct intervention.
Structure and Governance

The Service Provider Advisory Board will be composed of a diverse group of experts drawn from the ENS ecosystem:

    Technical Specialists: Experts with deep knowledge of ENS protocols and blockchain development.
    Security Professionals: Specialists skilled in vulnerability assessment and incident response.
    Operational Leaders: Representatives from established service providers with practical insights.
    User Advocates: Community members representing the broader interests of ENS users.
    Legal Advisors: Professionals knowledgeable about evolving regulatory requirements.
    DevRel Liaisons: Individuals with expertise in developer relations who will bridge communication between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers.

Members will be elected through a decentralized, token-weighted process managed by the ENS DAO and will serve staggered two-year terms. Decisions will be reached via consensus, with an escalation mechanism to the ENS DAO for unresolved issues. All meetings and decisions will be documented on the standalone website, which will serve as the centralized repository for Board-related content.
Responsibilities and Functions

Standards Development and Enforcement:
The Board will define and continuously update detailed technical and operational standards, including guidelines for API design, SDK development, data handling, privacy, and security measures. These standards will be published on the standalone website and refined as new technologies and threats emerge.

Accreditation Process:
Service providers will submit extensive technical documentation outlining their architectural designs and security protocols. Each submission will undergo rigorous evaluation through technical reviews, independent third-party audits, and security assessments. Providers meeting the benchmarks will be accredited for one year, subject to annual reassessments. Evaluation will include metrics such as the Expense Rate—providing objective data on cost efficiency (e.g., dollars per subname minted).

Developer Relations and Community Engagement:
The Board will act as a central hub for communication between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the developer community. Regular office hours will offer personalized support, and quarterly workshops and panel discussions will disseminate best practices and encourage collaboration. This ensures that service providers not only meet technical standards but also drive collective innovation.

Subdomain Endorsement and Organizational Oversight:
Recognizing the growing role of subdomains for institutional .eth TLD holders, the Board will oversee the implementation of authenticated supplemental contracts. These contracts will be audited—externally by third parties or internally via ENS DAO mechanisms—and will enforce a tiered fee structure. As the number of subdomain registrants grows, the fee portion directed to the DAO will increase, providing a scalable revenue model. Registrants will also receive ERC or soulbound tokens containing metadata to document registration details and on-chain contributions.

Centralized Information Hub:
A standalone website will consolidate all Board-related documentation, performance dashboards, accreditation guidelines, and support resources. This platform will streamline access to critical information and serve as a living archive that captures the evolving standards and performance of the ENS ecosystem.
Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

The implementation will be executed in four phases:

Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Community Consultation and Proposal Refinement
Engage stakeholders via virtual town halls, ENS forum discussions, and Discord channels. Feedback from recent performance reports and community dialogues will be used to refine the proposal.

Phase 2 (Months 3–4): DAO Submission and Election
Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review and conduct a decentralized election of Board members to establish governance.

Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Infrastructure Setup and Pilot Accreditation
Develop the standalone website, deploy robust scheduling tools for regular office hours, and set up processes for third-party audits. Launch a pilot accreditation program with select service providers to validate the process and integrate feedback.

Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond): Full Rollout
Open the accreditation process to all service providers and launch the standalone website as the central repository for all Board activities. Institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments while fostering continuous community communication. Over the long term, work toward transitioning oversight to autonomous, community-driven processes—achieving a "hands-off" model as decentralization matures.
Budget and Funding

A sustainable funding model is essential. The proposed annual budget is approximately $265,000, allocated as follows:

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000

This version is aimed at experts already familiar with ENS, its governance, and its ecosystem, and it emphasizes the precise mechanisms, metrics, and developer relations (DevRel) functions.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal outlines the establishment of an advanced Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. The Board is designed to enforce rigorous technical and operational standards through a robust accreditation process, while serving as a DevRel hub linking ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader ENS development community. A key innovation is the integration of low-level performance metrics—most notably, the Expense Rate (calculated as the provider's monthly burn rate divided by its atomic metric, such as subnames minted)—to objectively assess efficiency. Additionally, the program will support subdomain implementations via audited supplemental contracts, tiered fee structures, and token issuance for metadata, all of which will be managed through a centralized standalone website.
Specifics of the Program
1. Accreditation and Performance Metrics

    Accreditation Process:
    Service providers must submit detailed technical documentation (architectural designs, security protocols, and operational procedures). Submissions will undergo rigorous technical reviews, independent third-party code audits, and comprehensive security assessments. Providers meeting the set benchmarks will be accredited for one year, with mandatory annual reassessments.

    Performance Metrics:
    A central metric is the Expense Rate, defined as the monthly burn rate divided by the number of atomic operations (e.g., subnames minted). For instance, if a provider burns $200 per month and mints 100 subnames, the Expense Rate is $2 per subname. This, along with other low-level performance data (such as resolution times and operation counts), will be monitored continuously via a Metrics Board and integrated into the accreditation decision-making process.

2. Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

    DevRel Hub Function:
    The Advisory Board will act as a liaison among ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader ENS development community. Regular weekly office hours, quarterly technical workshops, and panel discussions will be scheduled to facilitate knowledge sharing and address technical challenges, ensuring that improvements in service provider implementations are quickly disseminated and adopted.

    Integration with Core ENS Development:
    The Board will work closely with ENS Labs to align service provider standards with ongoing protocol upgrades (e.g., ENS v2 improvements and Gasless DNS implementations) and integration efforts with Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Base and Linea).

3. Subdomain Endorsement and Fee Mechanism

    Subdomain Authentication:
    To support subdomain functionality under .eth TLDs, the Board will oversee the deployment of supplemental contracts. These contracts—subject to rigorous audits by third-party teams or internal ENS DAO mechanisms—ensure that subdomain registration processes are secure and verifiable.

    Tiered Fee Structure:
    A dynamic fee model will be implemented where registration fees are determined by the number of subdomain registrants, with predefined tiers (e.g., Tier A: 1–500, Tier B: 501–2500, Tier C: 2501+). As registration volume increases, a proportional share of fees will be directed to the DAO, incentivizing high-quality, scalable implementations.

    Tokenized Metadata:
    Registrants will receive an ERC or soulbound token that captures key metadata (registration date, duration, privileges, and on-chain contributions). This mechanism reinforces trust and provides an immutable record of participation.

4. Standalone Website and Centralized Information Hub

    Website Development:
    A dedicated, standalone website will be built to host all Advisory Board materials. This includes accreditation guidelines, performance dashboards (with real-time metrics such as Expense Rate), audit reports, and support resources. The platform is designed to abstract away forum clutter, providing a streamlined, expert-focused interface that serves as the definitive reference for all Board-related activities.

    Continuous Updates and Documentation:
    All meetings, decisions, and policy updates will be published on this website to ensure complete transparency. It will also serve as a repository for historical performance data and a tool for tracking ongoing improvements across service providers.

5. Long-Term Decentralization and “Hands-Off” Governance

    Autonomous Oversight:
    While the Board will initially provide intensive oversight and developer support, the long-term vision is to transition to a decentralized, “hands-off” model. Over time, as standards mature and community processes become self-sustaining, ongoing quality control and compliance will be maintained autonomously via community-driven mechanisms, minimizing the need for direct Board intervention.

Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

    Phase 1 (Months 1–2):
    Conduct virtual town halls and engage with ENS forums and Discord channels for feedback. Refine accreditation standards and performance metrics, including Expense Rate benchmarks.

    Phase 2 (Months 3–4):
    Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review and conduct a decentralized election of Board members.

    Phase 3 (Months 5–6):
    Develop and launch the standalone website, deploy scheduling tools for office hours, and set up processes for third-party audits. Initiate a pilot accreditation round with select service providers.

    Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond):
    Open full accreditation to all service providers, publish performance dashboards and audit results on the website, and institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments. Begin transitioning towards a decentralized oversight model.

Budget and Funding

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000
        Administrative coordinator: $50,000

    Technical Infrastructure:
        Communication and scheduling tools: $10,000
        Website maintenance (hosting, updates, content management): $5,000

    Accreditation and Security Audits:
        Independent third-party security audits: $50,000
        Operational accreditation costs (technical evaluations, code audits): $20,000

    Community Engagement:
        Workshops, panel discussions, and office hours: $15,000
        Outreach materials and documentation: $5,000

    Contingency Fund:
        Unforeseen expenses: $10,000

Total Annual Budget: ~$265,000
Funding will primarily be sourced from ENS DAO treasury allocations (subject to governance approval) and supplemented by nominal accreditation fees, with external grants and sponsorships actively pursued.
Conclusion

This proposal defines a concrete, technical framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. By enforcing rigorous standards and leveraging precise performance metrics like the Expense Rate, the Board will ensure the highest quality, security, and interoperability of ENS services. Its role as a DevRel hub will bridge ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the developer community, while the centralized standalone website will serve as the authoritative source for all Board-related activities. Furthermore, the oversight of subdomain registration—through authenticated supplemental contracts and tiered fee structures—will drive revenue and enhance trust. Ultimately, the long-term vision is to transition to a decentralized, “hands‑off” model where community-driven processes sustain system integrity autonomously. We invite expert stakeholders to review this proposal, provide critical feedback, and support its implementation to further advance the ENS ecosystem.

this wiuill be an attestatsion using EAS

Below is the updated version of the proposal that incorporates the use of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for validating and attesting the information submitted by service providers. This attestation mechanism is designed to add an extra layer of trust and verification to the accreditation process, ensuring that all data provided (such as performance metrics and compliance details) is verifiable on-chain.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal outlines a framework for establishing an advanced Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. The Board will enforce rigorous technical and operational standards through a robust accreditation process, leveraging low-level performance metrics—most notably Expense Rate (calculated as the provider's monthly burn rate divided by a key operational metric, e.g. subnames minted)—to objectively assess efficiency. Furthermore, the Board will serve as a DevRel hub linking the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. A critical innovation in this proposal is the integration of on-chain attestation using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to validate service provider submissions. In parallel, the initiative will support subdomain functionality via audited supplemental contracts and a tiered fee mechanism, all coordinated through a dedicated standalone website.
Specifics of the Program
Accreditation and On-Chain Attestation

    Accreditation Process:
    Service providers must submit comprehensive technical documentation (including architectural designs, security protocols, and operational procedures) via a designated attestation interface. Each submission will undergo rigorous technical reviews, independent third-party audits, and comprehensive security assessments. Providers meeting the established benchmarks will be accredited for one year, subject to annual reassessments.

    Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS):
    As part of the accreditation process, providers’ submissions will be attested on-chain using EAS. This attestation will serve as a verifiable record that the submitted data—such as performance metrics, audit reports, and compliance certifications—has been reviewed and validated by the Advisory Board. The EAS attestation adds an extra layer of trust, enabling stakeholders to independently verify that the provider meets the defined standards.

    Performance Metrics:
    Key metrics include subnames minted, resolutions, and burn rate. For example, if a provider burns $200/month and mints 100 subnames, its Expense Rate is $2 per subname. These metrics will be recorded on-chain and tied to the provider’s attestation record, ensuring transparent, immutable data for evaluation.

Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

    DevRel Hub Function:
    The Advisory Board will operate as a central liaison among the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community. Regular office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions will be held to facilitate direct technical support and collaborative innovation.

    Integration with Core ENS Development:
    The Board will work closely with ENS Labs to ensure that service provider standards align with ongoing protocol upgrades (e.g., ENS v2 improvements, Gasless DNS) and integration with Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Base, Linea).

Subdomain Oversight and Fee Mechanism

    Subdomain Supplemental Contracts:
    The Board will oversee the deployment of audited supplemental contracts that enable secure subdomain registration under .eth TLDs. These contracts, subject to EAS attestation, will enforce a tiered fee structure based on the number of subdomain registrants (e.g., Tier A: 1–500, Tier B: 501–2500, Tier C: 2501+).

    Tokenized Metadata:
    Registrants will receive an ERC or soulbound token containing metadata (registration date, duration, privileges, on-chain contribution history) to further enhance trust and transparency.

Standalone Website and Centralized Information Hub

    Centralized Platform:
    A dedicated standalone website will be developed to consolidate all Board-related content, including accreditation guidelines, performance dashboards, audit results (with EAS attestation references), and support resources. This platform will replace the traditional forum-based communication, providing a streamlined, expert-focused interface.

Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

Phase 1 (Months 1–2):
Engage stakeholders via virtual town halls and ENS forums to gather feedback. Refine accreditation standards, performance metrics, and the EAS attestation process.

Phase 2 (Months 3–4):
Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review and conduct a decentralized election of Board members.

Phase 3 (Months 5–6):
Develop and launch the standalone website, deploy scheduling tools for office hours, and establish EAS attestation workflows. Initiate a pilot accreditation round with select service providers.

Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond):
Open the full accreditation process, publish performance dashboards and EAS attestation records on the website, and institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments. Begin transitioning toward a decentralized, “hands‑off” oversight model.
Budget and Funding

The proposed annual budget is approximately $265,000, allocated as follows:

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000
        Administrative coordinator: $50,000

    Technical Infrastructure:
        Advanced communication and scheduling tools: $10,000
        Standalone website maintenance: $5,000

    Accreditation and Security Audits:
        Independent third-party security audits: $50,000
        Operational costs for accreditation (technical evaluations and code audits): $20,000

    Community Engagement:
        Workshops, panel discussions, and office hours: $15,000
        Outreach materials and documentation: $5,000

    Contingency Fund:
        Unforeseen expenses: $10,000

Funding will primarily be sourced from ENS DAO treasury allocations (subject to governance approval), supplemented by nominal accreditation fees and external grants or sponsorships.
Conclusion

This proposal defines a technical and governance framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2 that leverages the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for on-chain validation of service provider credentials. By enforcing rigorous technical and operational standards, implementing a comprehensive accreditation process anchored by objective metrics such as Expense Rate, and functioning as a central DevRel hub, the Board will elevate the quality, security, and interoperability of ENS services. The integrated subdomain oversight mechanism—with tiered fee structures and tokenized metadata—will generate new revenue streams and foster trust, while the standalone website will consolidate all Board-related information into a single, accessible resource. Ultimately, this initiative lays the foundation for a long-term decentralized, “hands‑off” oversight model, ensuring that ENS remains a beacon of digital freedom and innovation for generations to come.

create an attestation process that will automatically receive information from service provider contracts to attest statistical data based on contract events. this will also hel keep track of service provieder official contrats

Below is a detailed outline of an automated attestation process using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) that ingests statistical data directly from service provider contracts based on emitted events. This process is designed to both validate key performance metrics in real time and maintain an immutable record of official service provider contracts.
Automated Attestation Process Architecture
1. Event Emission by Service Provider Contracts

Each official service provider contract will be instrumented to emit standardized events whenever significant actions occur. Examples include:

    Subname Minted:
    An event is emitted whenever a subdomain is registered. This event contains data such as the timestamp, subname identifier, and the transaction details.

    Resolution Processed:
    An event is emitted for every resolution, capturing the number of resolutions, success/failure status, and relevant gas usage.

    Operational Metrics Update:
    Periodic events that report on metrics such as the provider’s burn rate, operation counts (e.g., list creation, API calls), and other performance data.

The events will include standardized data fields to allow automated parsing by the off-chain attestation system.
2. Off-Chain Event Listener and Data Aggregation

A dedicated off-chain service (or a set of services) will continuously listen to these contract events using Ethereum event filtering (for example, through Web3 libraries or The Graph protocol). This listener will:

    Aggregate Data:
    Collect data from events in real time. For instance, it will calculate the number of subnames minted over a given period, the total number of resolutions processed, and the corresponding burn rate.

    Compute Derived Metrics:
    Automatically calculate key metrics such as the Expense Rate (e.g., monthly burn rate divided by the number of subnames minted) based on the raw data from events.

    Store and Format Data:
    Temporarily store aggregated data in a secure off-chain database and format it into a structure that can be used by the attestation process.

3. On-Chain Attestation via EAS

Using the Ethereum Attestation Service, the aggregated and computed data is then submitted as an attestation. The attestation process involves:

    Data Submission Contract:
    A dedicated attestation smart contract that receives the off-chain aggregated data. This contract acts as an intermediary, verifying that the data meets a predefined schema (such as the JSON schema outlined in previous sections) and then writing an immutable attestation record on-chain.

    EAS Integration:
    The attestation is performed using EAS functions. The off-chain service calls EAS’s attestation function with the following details:
        Provider Identifier: The ENS name or address of the service provider.
        Metric Data: Aggregated data such as subnames minted, resolutions processed, burn rate, and calculated Expense Rate.
        Timestamp and Metadata: Including when the data was aggregated and any supplementary audit results.

    EAS then records this attestation on-chain, making the statistical data verifiable and tamper-resistant.

4. Tracking and Record-Keeping of Official Contracts

The process also includes a registry function:

    Contract Registry Module:
    A smart contract module dedicated to maintaining a registry of all official service provider contracts. Each registered contract is linked with its attestation records.

    Automated Updates:
    When a new contract is deployed or when a significant update occurs (for example, a contract upgrade that triggers a re-attestation), the event listener detects this change and automatically updates the registry. This ensures that the DAO and community have a current, on-chain record of all officially attested service provider contracts and their performance metrics.

    Historical Archive:
    All attestation records, along with contract registry data, are maintained on-chain and are accessible via a centralized dashboard on the standalone website.

5. Dashboard and Standalone Website Integration

A dedicated standalone website will serve as the user interface for the entire attestation process:

    Real-Time Dashboard:
    The website will display real-time metrics pulled from the on-chain attestations, including Expense Rate, subnames minted, resolution success rates, and other key performance indicators.

    Historical Data Archive:
    The dashboard will include tools for browsing historical attestation records, enabling stakeholders to track performance trends over time.

    API Access:
    The website can provide API endpoints for external applications to query attestation data and contract registry information, enhancing interoperability with other ENS ecosystem tools.

Summary

This automated attestation process leverages service provider contract events, off-chain aggregation, and on-chain attestation using EAS to validate and record statistical data in real time. By integrating a dedicated contract registry and a centralized dashboard on a standalone website, the system not only ensures the accuracy and immutability of performance metrics but also maintains an up-to-date record of all official service provider contracts. This approach bolsters transparency, fosters trust, and facilitates efficient, community-driven oversight—paving the way for a future where ENS governance becomes increasingly decentralized and “hands‑off.”

no this will be solely on chain

Below is a revised on‑chain attestation process that relies solely on blockchain mechanisms, utilizing the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to automatically record and validate statistical data from service provider contracts. This design ensures that all data—from performance metrics to contract registry updates—is captured, verified, and stored on chain, without any off‑chain components.
On‑Chain Attestation Process Architecture
1. Instrumenting Service Provider Contracts

Each official service provider contract must be instrumented to emit standardized events directly on chain. Examples include:

    SubnameMinted Event:
    Emitted every time a new subdomain is registered. The event payload includes the subname identifier, timestamp, and the registrar’s address.

    ResolutionProcessed Event:
    Emitted for each successful resolution, capturing the resolution identifier, success status, gas usage, and timestamp.

    Operational Metrics Event:
    Periodically emitted events that report metrics such as the provider’s current burn rate, the number of API calls, and any other operational statistics required for performance measurement.

These events serve as the raw data source for on-chain calculations.
2. On‑Chain Data Aggregation and Metric Calculation

A dedicated smart contract (the Metrics Aggregator) will be deployed to listen to and aggregate data from the standardized events. This contract will:

    Filter and Aggregate Events:
    Use on-chain event filtering mechanisms (via Solidity or in combination with off‑chain indexing tools that update the contract state through on-chain transactions) to aggregate metrics such as the total number of subnames minted and total resolutions processed within defined time intervals.

    Calculate Derived Metrics:
    Compute key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Expense Rate. For example, the Expense Rate is computed on chain as:
    Expense Rate=Provider Burn Rate (in USD equivalent)Number of Subnames Minted
    Expense Rate=Number of Subnames MintedProvider Burn Rate (in USD equivalent)​

    This value is updated automatically as new events are recorded.

    Store Aggregated Data:
    Persist aggregated values in contract state variables, ensuring that the performance metrics are immutable and publicly accessible on chain.

3. Automated Attestation via EAS

The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) will be integrated with the Metrics Aggregator to automatically attest the aggregated data:

    Attestation Trigger:
    A function within the Metrics Aggregator contract is designed to trigger an attestation at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or after a predefined number of events). This function packages the current aggregated metrics (e.g., subnames minted, burn rate, calculated Expense Rate) along with metadata such as timestamps.

    On‑Chain Attestation Submission:
    The Metrics Aggregator calls the EAS attestation function, submitting the packaged data as an attestation record. This record is then stored on chain, providing an immutable, verifiable record that the service provider’s performance has been reviewed.

    Verification:
    Any stakeholder can verify the attestation data by querying the EAS records, ensuring that the metrics are accurate and that the provider is meeting the established standards.

4. Official Contract Registry

A separate smart contract (the Contract Registry) will be deployed to maintain a record of all official service provider contracts. This contract will:

    Register Service Provider Contracts:
    Upon deployment or update of a service provider contract, its address and relevant metadata (such as ENS name, deployment timestamp, and contract version) are recorded on chain.

    Link to Attestation Records:
    Each contract entry will be linked to its corresponding attestation records from EAS, ensuring that there is a clear, verifiable association between the provider’s contract and its performance metrics.

    Immutable Record:
    All entries are stored immutably on chain, providing a permanent, public record of all officially endorsed service provider contracts.

5. On‑Chain Data Accessibility and Dashboard (On‑Chain View)

While the entire process is on chain, a simple on‑chain interface (or a light off‑chain viewer that reads directly from on‑chain data without affecting the trustless nature) can be developed to allow stakeholders to query:

    Real-Time Metrics:
    Subnames minted, resolutions processed, current Expense Rate, etc.

    Historical Attestations:
    A list of all EAS attestations, with timestamps and associated metric data.

    Contract Registry:
    Details of all registered service provider contracts and links to their attestation records.

This interface can be implemented as a series of smart contract calls or a read-only dApp that interacts directly with the on‑chain data.
Summary

The proposed on‑chain attestation process utilizes service provider contract events, an on‑chain Metrics Aggregator, and the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to automatically record, validate, and store performance metrics. Additionally, an on‑chain Contract Registry ensures that all official service provider contracts are immutably tracked. This entirely on‑chain solution guarantees transparency, immutability, and trust, while supporting objective metrics (such as Expense Rate) for evaluating service provider efficiency. Stakeholders can verify all data on chain, and an optional read‑only dashboard can be built to facilitate user access without compromising the system’s decentralization.

develop example schemas

Below are two example JSON schemas that illustrate how on‑chain attestation data and official contract registry entries might be structured. These schemas are designed for use with the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and smart contracts that aggregate and attest performance data directly from service provider contracts. They are intended to be read and validated by experts and can serve as a starting point for developing the on‑chain attestation process.
Example Schema 1: Service Provider Attestation Record

This schema defines the structure for an attestation record submitted via EAS. It includes fields for provider identity, key performance metrics, and timestamps.

{

Analysis

    Attestation Record Schema:
        The ServiceProviderAttestation schema is designed to be submitted via EAS. It captures essential performance data, such as subnames minted and the calculated Expense Rate, ensuring that these metrics are verifiable on-chain.
        The auditDetails field allows for tracking the outcome of security audits, adding an extra layer of reliability.

    Contract Registry Schema:
        The ServiceProviderContractRegistryEntry schema maintains a permanent record of official service provider contracts. It links each contract to its related attestation records, ensuring transparency and traceability.
        Metadata such as the deployment date, version, and registrar details help track contract evolution over time.

Both schemas are designed for on‑chain use, ensuring that all data is recorded, verifiable, and immutable, in line with the goal of a fully decentralized, “hands‑off” oversight process.

how would we tie this attestation syttem together into its own system controlled by the service porovider registry board

Below is a detailed explanation of how the on‑chain attestation system can be tied together into its own autonomous system, governed and controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board. This design leverages smart contracts to capture, verify, and aggregate performance data using EAS, and it integrates this functionality into a centralized registry system that the Board manages on chain.

When a service provider deploys its contract, it is instrumented to emit standardized events (such as subname minting, resolution processing, or periodic operational metrics). These events are consumed by an on‑chain Metrics Aggregator Contract that continuously aggregates the data and computes derived metrics (for example, the Expense Rate calculated by dividing the monthly burn rate by the number of subnames minted). Once the Metrics Aggregator accumulates a predefined batch of data or after a specific time interval, it automatically triggers an attestation function within the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).

The EAS integration functions by taking the aggregated metrics (including subnames minted, resolutions processed, burn rate, and calculated Expense Rate) and submitting an attestation record on chain. This record is immutable and verifiable by any stakeholder, providing a trustless snapshot of the provider’s performance. The attestation record includes metadata such as the provider’s Ethereum address, ENS name, timestamp, and audit details.

Concurrently, a separate Contract Registry is maintained by the Service Provider Registry Board. This on‑chain registry stores a record for each official service provider contract. Each record includes essential details (contract address, ENS name, deployment date, version, etc.) along with references (e.g., attestation record IDs) linking it to its corresponding performance attestations. This registry serves as the definitive ledger of approved, audited service provider contracts.

To tie these components together under Board control, the Advisory Board will oversee several key functions via a governance contract (or a multi‑sig mechanism) that has authority over both the Metrics Aggregator and Contract Registry contracts. This governance layer can:

• Update system parameters (such as thresholds for triggering attestations or fee schedules in the supplemental subdomain contracts).
• Initiate manual attestations if required, ensuring that even in cases of anomalous data the Board can intervene.
• Approve or deprecate service provider contracts via on‑chain votes, thereby maintaining an up‑to‑date registry of official providers.

Because the entire system operates on chain, all interactions—from event emissions and metric calculations to attestations and registry updates—are transparent and immutable. The standalone website, although providing a user interface, simply acts as a read‑only portal that queries these smart contracts directly, ensuring that data integrity is maintained without compromising decentralization. In essence, the Board-controlled system functions as an integrated suite of smart contracts:

    A Metrics Aggregator that listens to service provider events, computes performance metrics, and triggers attestations.
    An EAS-enabled attestation contract that records the performance data on chain.
    A Service Provider Registry that catalogs official contracts and links them to their attestations.
    A Governance Contract that enables the Registry Board to update parameters, validate attestations, and ensure that the system operates according to community‑driven standards.

This fully on‑chain solution not only automates data collection and verification but also supports a long‑term vision where oversight gradually becomes “hands‑off” as the system matures and community‑driven processes assume responsibility for quality, security, and interoperability.

example code

Below is an example implementation in Solidity that ties together an on‑chain attestation system with a service provider registry. In this example, service provider contracts emit events (such as subname minting and resolution processing) that—while normally not directly accessible to contracts—are simulated here by update calls. A dedicated MetricsAggregator contract aggregates these data, calculates derived metrics (e.g., Expense Rate), and then triggers an attestation via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Finally, a ServiceProviderRegistry contract records official service provider contracts and links them to their attestation IDs. In a real-world deployment, the process would be entirely on chain, with the provider contracts calling update functions to report events and the MetricsAggregator performing the necessary calculations and attestations. Note that proper access control (for instance using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable or AccessControl) should be added in production.

Explanation

    ServiceProvider Contract:
        This contract simulates a service provider that emits events for key operations (subname minting, resolution processing, and burn rate updates).

    MetricsAggregator Contract:
        The updateMetrics function allows authorized calls (in practice, proper access control is required) to update metrics based on event data.
        The attestMetrics function packages the aggregated metrics and calls the attest function of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to record an immutable attestation on chain.

    ServiceProviderRegistry Contract:
        This contract allows the registry of official service provider contracts and links them to their corresponding attestation IDs.
        It provides an immutable record of each registered contract, along with its deployment details and historical attestation data.

Together, these contracts form a fully on‑chain attestation system managed by the Service Provider Registry Board. The system automates the collection of statistical data from provider contracts, attests it using EAS, and maintains a permanent, verifiable record of all official service provider contracts—all without relying on any off‑chain components.

//    aggregates the metrics, and computes derived values such as Expense Rate.
    
// 4. At regular intervals (or when triggered by a board member), the MetricsAggregator calls attestMetrics(provider),
//    which packages the aggregated data and submits it to the EAS for an immutable on-chain attestation.
    
// 5. The resulting attestationId is returned and then linked to the corresponding service provider contract
//    by calling linkAttestation in the ServiceProviderRegistry contract.
    
// 6. The Governance contract allows the Registry Board to update parameters, trigger manual attestations,
//    and manage the list of registered service providers.
    
// 7. A standalone website (read-only dApp) queries these on-chain contracts to display real-time metrics,
//    historical attestation records, and the official registry of service provider contracts, all maintained entirely on-chain.

Analysis

    The pseudocode outlines a system composed entirely of smart contracts:
        ServiceProvider: Emits events when operations occur.
        MetricsAggregator: Aggregates event data, computes metrics, and triggers attestations using EAS.
        EAS Interface: Represents the on-chain attestation mechanism.
        ServiceProviderRegistry: Records official contracts and links them to attestation records.
        Governance: Enables the board to manage system parameters and perform manual attestations.
    The entire process operates on chain, with a potential read‑only standalone website as a user interface that interacts directly with the on‑chain data.

This pseudocode provides a detailed blueprint that can be further developed into a fully working on‑chain solution.

essentially we need a hiearchal hybrid smartcontract and attestation system that maps our  archtecture

Below is a description and high‑level pseudocode outline for a hierarchical hybrid smart contract and attestation system that maps the proposed architecture. This design establishes multiple layers—each handling specific responsibilities—while integrating on‑chain attestations via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). The system is organized hierarchically to enable modularity, clear separation of concerns, and robust governance by the Service Provider Registry Board.
Architectural Overview

    Service Provider Layer:
    Each service provider deploys its own smart contract (or set of contracts) that emits standardized events when key operations occur (e.g., subname minting, resolution processing, burn rate updates). These contracts serve as the data source for performance metrics.

    Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer:
    A dedicated Metrics Aggregator smart contract listens for events from the service provider contracts. It aggregates the data (e.g., total subnames minted, resolutions processed, and burn rate) and calculates derived metrics such as Expense Rate. At predefined intervals or upon reaching certain thresholds, the aggregator packages the data and submits it for an on‑chain attestation via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). The attestation creates an immutable record of the provider’s performance metrics.

    Service Provider Registry Layer:
    The Service Provider Registry smart contract maintains a ledger of all official service provider contracts. It stores key metadata (e.g., ENS name, deployment date, version) and links each contract to its corresponding attestation records. This registry ensures that the Board has an authoritative, up‑to‑date list of verified providers.

    Governance and Oversight Layer:
    A Governance smart contract (or a multi‑sig mechanism) is controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board. This layer allows the board to update system parameters (such as thresholds for attestation triggers or fee structures), manually initiate attestations if needed, and manage the registry of official service provider contracts. Over time, this layer is designed to transition toward a decentralized “hands‑off” model where oversight is maintained autonomously through community‑driven processes.

    User Interface (Read-Only):
    Although the system is entirely on‑chain, a standalone website or dApp can be developed as a read‑only interface. This front end will query the smart contracts to display real‑time metrics, historical attestation records, and official contract registry data, thereby abstracting away the complexity of on‑chain data and providing an accessible view for stakeholders.

High-Level Pseudocode Outline

Below is pseudocode that illustrates how these layers interact:

// =======================================================

        m.burnRate = newBurnRate  // Assumed to be updated monthly
        m.lastUpdated = current_timestamp
        if m.subnamesMinted > 0 then
            m.expenseRateSubname = m.burnRate / m.subnamesMinted
        end if
        providerMetrics[provider] = m
    }
    
    // Trigger an attestation of the current metrics via EAS
    function attestMetrics(provider) returns (attestationId) {
        m = providerMetrics[provider]
        data = encode(provider, m.subnamesMinted, m.resolutionsProcessed, m.burnRate, m.expenseRateSubname, m.lastUpdated)
        attestationId = EAS(easContractAddress).attest(data)
        emit MetricsAttested(provider, m.expenseRateSubname, current_timestamp, attestationId)
        return attestationId
    }
}

System Flow

    Service Provider Contracts:
        Each provider contract emits events (e.g., SubnameMinted, ResolutionProcessed, BurnRateUpdated) as operations occur.

    Metrics Aggregation:
        The Metrics Aggregator contract collects these event data (via direct function calls triggered by the provider or an on‑chain relay), updates aggregated metrics, and computes derived values (Expense Rate).

    Automated Attestation:
        At regular intervals or when triggered by the Governance layer, the aggregator encodes the latest metrics and submits them to the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) via an on‑chain call, which returns an attestation ID.

    Contract Registry Update:
        The Service Provider Registry records the official contract details and links the new attestation record to the corresponding provider.

    Governance Oversight:
        The Governance contract, controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board, allows board members to update parameters, trigger manual attestations, and manage the official registry—all entirely on chain.

    Read-Only Dashboard:
        A read-only dApp queries the on‑chain contracts to display real‑time metrics, historical attestation data, and the official registry of service provider contracts.

Conclusion

This hierarchical, hybrid smart contract system leverages on‑chain event data, automated aggregation, and the Ethereum Attestation Service to create a fully decentralized, trustless attestation and registry system. Managed by the Service Provider Registry Board, this system ensures that performance metrics are objectively measured and verified, official contracts are immutably recorded, and oversight functions are maintained by a governance layer with the eventual goal of transitioning to a fully autonomous, "hands‑off" system.

Below is the complete, final proposal that integrates all previously discussed components. This document details the hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation and registry system—leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for immutable, trustless data verification—and emphasizes its role as a DevRel hub to link the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community. The proposal is intended for experts familiar with ENS and its ecosystem, focusing on the specific technical and governance mechanisms rather than introductory background.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2. The system will be entirely on chain and is designed to enforce rigorous technical and operational standards, integrate automated attestations via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), and maintain an immutable registry of official service provider contracts. Acting as a developer relations (DevRel) hub, the Board will bridge the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community. A standalone website will serve as a centralized read‑only interface for all on‑chain data, abstracting away traditional forum clutter while ensuring transparency and ease of access.
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by transforming cryptographic addresses into easily memorable names, heralding a new era of digital identity. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it now supports a vast ecosystem—including wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, and API aggregators—that is reshaping blockchain interactions. However, rapid growth has led to disparities in technical implementations, security protocols, and operational practices. This proposal establishes a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2 to enforce strict standards and implement a robust, entirely on‑chain attestation system. By utilizing EAS, the system automatically records and validates key performance metrics (such as the Expense Rate) and maintains a registry of official service provider contracts. In addition, it will function as a DevRel hub, linking ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and developers while progressing toward a decentralized, “hands‑off” governance model.
Detailed Proposal
1. On‑Chain Attestation and Registry System
A. Service Provider Contract Layer

Each service provider deploys its own contract that emits standardized events on key operations:

    SubnameMinted: Emitted when a new subdomain is registered.
    ResolutionProcessed: Emitted upon processing a resolution.
    BurnRateUpdated: Emitted when the provider updates its monthly burn rate.

These events are the raw data source for performance metrics.
B. Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer

A dedicated Metrics Aggregator smart contract will:

    Aggregate Data: Listen to events from provider contracts and update internal metrics (e.g., total subnames minted, resolutions processed, current burn rate).
    Calculate Derived Metrics: Compute key figures such as Expense Rate (e.g., burnRate divided by subnamesMinted).
    Automate Attestation: At defined intervals or thresholds, package the aggregated data (including provider identity, metrics, and timestamps) and call the EAS attestation function. The resulting attestation record (with an attestation ID) is stored on chain.

C. Service Provider Registry Layer

A separate Service Provider Registry contract will:

    Record Contract Metadata: Store details of each official service provider contract, including its Ethereum address, associated ENS name, deployment date, and version.
    Link Attestation Records: Maintain an array of attestation IDs linked to each registered provider, ensuring a verifiable history of performance attestations.
    Immutable Record: Provide a permanent ledger of all officially endorsed service provider contracts.

D. Governance and Oversight Layer

A Governance contract, managed by the Service Provider Registry Board, will:

    Parameter Updates: Allow board members to update system parameters (e.g., thresholds for triggering attestations or fee structures).
    Manual Interventions: Enable manual triggering of attestations when anomalies are detected.
    Registry Management: Provide functions to approve or deprecate service provider contracts and update registry entries, all through on‑chain votes or multi‑sig approvals.

E. Standalone Website (Read‑Only Interface)

A dedicated website will be built as a read‑only portal that:

    Queries On‑Chain Data: Retrieves real‑time metrics, historical attestation records, and registry entries.
    Consolidates Documentation: Serves as a centralized repository for accreditation guidelines, audit results, and support resources.
    User Experience: Offers a streamlined, user-friendly interface that abstracts away the complexities of on‑chain data and forum clutter.

2. Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

The Advisory Board will function as a DevRel hub by:

    Facilitating Communication: Hosting weekly office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions to provide direct guidance and promote best practices.
    Aligning with ENS Labs: Collaborating closely with ENS Labs to ensure that service provider standards evolve alongside protocol upgrades (e.g., ENS v2 improvements, Gasless DNS) and integration efforts with Layer 2 solutions.
    Community Engagement: Acting as the primary point of contact for developers, ensuring that technical challenges are addressed and innovations are rapidly disseminated across the ecosystem.

3. Subdomain Oversight and Fee Mechanism

The system will support advanced subdomain functionalities through:

    Supplemental Contracts: Overseeing the deployment of supplemental contracts (attested via EAS) that enable secure subdomain registration under .eth TLDs.
    Tiered Fee Structure: Implementing a dynamic fee model where fees vary by registration tiers (e.g., Tier A: 1–500, Tier B: 501–2500, Tier C: 2501+), with a portion of fees directed to the DAO.
    Tokenized Metadata: Issuing ERC or soulbound tokens to registrants that include metadata such as registration date, duration, roles, and on‑chain contribution history, enhancing transparency and trust.

4. Implementation Roadmap and Timeline

Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Community Consultation and Refinement
Engage stakeholders through virtual town halls and ENS forums to gather feedback. Refine accreditation standards, performance metrics, and EAS attestation parameters based on recent discussions.

Phase 2 (Months 3–4): DAO Submission and Board Election
Submit the refined proposal to the ENS DAO for formal review. Conduct a decentralized election of Board members to establish the governance framework.

Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Infrastructure Setup and Pilot Run
Develop and deploy the Metrics Aggregator, Service Provider Registry, and Governance contracts. Launch the standalone website as the centralized interface. Initiate a pilot accreditation round with select service providers, recording performance metrics via EAS.

Phase 4 (Month 7 and Beyond): Full Rollout and Decentralized Transition
Open the accreditation process to all service providers. Fully integrate on‑chain attestation records with the registry and publish data on the standalone website. Institutionalize regular office hours, periodic audits, and annual reassessments. Over time, transition oversight to a decentralized, community‑driven “hands‑off” model.
5. Budget and Funding

The annual budget is estimated at $265,000 and will be allocated as follows:

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000
        Administrative coordinator: $50,000

    Technical Infrastructure:
        Advanced communication and scheduling tools: $10,000
        Standalone website maintenance: $5,000

    Accreditation and Security Audits:
        Independent third-party security audits: $50,000
        Operational costs for accreditation (technical evaluations and code audits): $20,000

    Community Engagement:
        Workshops, panel discussions, and office hours: $15,000
        Outreach materials and documentation: $5,000

    Contingency Fund:
        Unforeseen expenses: $10,000

Funding will primarily come from ENS DAO treasury allocations (subject to governance approval) and supplemented by nominal accreditation fees and external grants or sponsorships.
Conclusion

This proposal defines a hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation and registry system designed to elevate the ENS ecosystem through rigorous performance metrics, robust security standards, and seamless integration with developer initiatives. By leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for automated, immutable on‑chain attestations and implementing a dedicated, governance‑controlled registry, the system ensures that only the highest-quality service providers are accredited. Furthermore, the Board will serve as a DevRel hub, connecting ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community, while also facilitating advanced subdomain functionality via tiered fee structures and tokenized metadata. With the long‑term vision of achieving a decentralized, “hands‑off” oversight model, this initiative sets a bold course for future innovation and stands as a testament to ENS’s transformative impact on digital identity.

Below is a complete proposal that now includes high‑level pseudocode examples and a diagram illustrating the layered system architecture. This document is intended for experts and describes a hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation and registry system controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board, with automated attestations via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal defines a comprehensive, entirely on‑chain system to oversee and attest the performance of ENS service providers. The system is organized into several layers:

    Service Provider Contract Layer:
    Each service provider deploys its own contract that emits standardized events (e.g., subname minting, resolution processing, burn rate updates).

    Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer:
    A dedicated Metrics Aggregator smart contract collects event data, computes derived performance metrics (e.g., Expense Rate), and automatically triggers attestations via EAS.

    Service Provider Registry Layer:
    A Registry contract records all official service provider contracts along with their metadata and links each to its on‑chain attestation records.

    Governance and Oversight Layer:
    A Governance contract, controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board, enables parameter updates, manual attestations, and overall management of the system.

    User Interface Layer (Read‑Only):
    A standalone website acts as the centralized read‑only portal that queries these on‑chain contracts, displaying real‑time metrics, historical attestations, and the registry of official providers.

The long‑term vision is to transition to a decentralized, “hands‑off” model where community‑driven processes autonomously maintain quality, security, and interoperability.
Detailed Proposal
On‑Chain Attestation and Registry System
1. Service Provider Contract Layer

Each service provider contract emits events for critical operations:

    SubnameMinted: Emitted when a new subdomain is registered.
    ResolutionProcessed: Emitted when a resolution is processed.
    BurnRateUpdated: Emitted when the provider’s burn rate is updated.

2. Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer

A dedicated Metrics Aggregator contract listens for these events and performs the following functions:

    Aggregation: It updates cumulative metrics (e.g., total subnames minted, resolutions processed, burn rate).

    Calculation: It computes derived metrics such as the Expense Rate:
    Expense Rate=Burn RateSubnames Minted
    Expense Rate=Subnames MintedBurn Rate​

    Attestation: At defined intervals or upon trigger, it encodes the aggregated data and calls the EAS attestation function. The attestation record (with an attestation ID) is then stored on chain.

3. Service Provider Registry Layer

The Registry contract records official service provider contracts:

    Registration: Stores provider contract address, ENS name, deployment date, version, etc.
    Linking Attestations: Maintains an array of attestation IDs for each provider, ensuring a verifiable history of performance attestations.

4. Governance and Oversight Layer

The Governance contract (or multi‑sig system) provides the Service Provider Registry Board with on‑chain control over:

    Parameter Updates: Modifying thresholds and fee schedules.
    Manual Attestations: Triggering attestations when anomalies are detected.
    Registry Management: Approving, deprecating, or updating official provider records.

5. Standalone Website (User Interface)

A read‑only dApp (the standalone website) will query the on‑chain contracts to display:

    Real‑time metrics and historical attestation data.
    Official registry information.
    Aggregated performance dashboards and compliance documentation.

    mapping(address => ProviderRecord) public registry;
    address[] public registeredProviders;
    
    event ProviderRegistered(address indexed providerAddress, string ensName, uint256 deploymentDate);
    event AttestationLinked(address indexed providerAddress, uint256 attestationId);
    
    function registerProvider(address _contractAddress, string calldata _ensName, string calldata _version) external {

Explanation of Diagram

    Service Provider Contracts (SP):
    Emit standardized events (subname minted, resolution processed, burn rate updates).

    Metrics Aggregator (MA):
    Listens to SP events, aggregates data, computes derived metrics (like Expense Rate), and triggers on‑chain attestations via the EAS.

    Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS):
    Receives encoded metric data from MA and returns an immutable attestation record.

    Service Provider Registry (SR):
    Maintains a ledger of all official service provider contracts and links each to its corresponding attestation records.

    Governance Contract (GOV):
    Enables the Board to update system parameters, initiate manual attestations, and manage the registry, ensuring that the system remains robust and aligned with community standards.

    Standalone Website (UI):
    Acts as a read‑only interface that queries on‑chain data from MA and SR, displaying real‑time metrics, historical attestations, and registry records in a user‑friendly format.

Conclusion

This proposal defines a hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation system integrated with a service provider registry, governed by a dedicated Board. It leverages the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to validate key performance metrics automatically—using events emitted by provider contracts—and ties these attestations to an immutable registry. The system is designed as a modular, layered architecture with a read‑only standalone website for transparency and accessibility. This framework ensures that all service provider data is verified on chain, supporting a long‑term transition toward a decentralized, “hands‑off” governance model.

\\how would you oimporve this

Below is an analysis of potential improvements to the current design and proposal, based on best practices in on‑chain attestation, registry systems, and decentralized governance in the ENS ecosystem. I reviewed some recent discussions on similar topics and current trends in blockchain governance, and here are some suggestions to further enhance the system:
1. Enhanced Modularization and Upgradeability

Improvement:
Implement a modular, upgradeable design using proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin's Upgradeable Contracts). This ensures that as requirements evolve—such as new metrics or changes in the attestation protocol—the system can be upgraded without needing to redeploy all contracts.

Benefits:

    Future‑proofing the system against protocol changes.
    Reducing risks by isolating critical components (e.g., Metrics Aggregator vs. Registry).

2. Granular Access Control and Role-Based Permissions

Improvement:
Integrate a robust access control mechanism (using OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl) for each contract layer. Define distinct roles for data submission, attestation triggering, and administrative updates, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform sensitive operations.

Benefits:

    Prevents unauthorized updates to performance metrics.
    Ensures that only designated Board members or approved relayers can trigger manual attestations or modify registry entries.

3. On‑Chain Data Indexing and Query Optimization

Improvement:
Although the design is fully on‑chain, consider integrating a lightweight on‑chain indexing solution (e.g., using events with structured logs and, if necessary, on‑chain query functions) that enables efficient querying of historical attestations and registry entries. Tools like The Graph can be considered if you need a read‑only layer that doesn't compromise decentralization.

Benefits:

    Faster, more efficient data retrieval for the read‑only website interface.
    Improved scalability as the number of attestations grows.

4. Enhanced Metrics and Automated Remediation

Improvement:
Expand the Metrics Aggregator to not only compute Expense Rate but also other key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resolution latency, error rates, or uptime. Integrate automated alerts or even automated remediation triggers when metrics fall below a predefined threshold.

Benefits:

    Provides a more holistic view of provider performance.
    Allows proactive intervention (or board notifications) when issues are detected.

5. Improved Integration with EAS

Improvement:
Enhance the attestation process by incorporating additional metadata from EAS attestations (such as cryptographic proofs of the attestation’s integrity) and linking these proofs to off-chain documentation in a verifiable manner (using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS with content addressing).

Benefits:

    Increases trust in the attestation records.
    Facilitates audits and third‑party verifications.

6. Decentralized Governance Transition

Improvement:
Design the Governance contract to incorporate more advanced DAO mechanisms, such as quadratic voting or delegate override features, to ensure that as the system matures, decision-making becomes more decentralized and less reliant on a few central actors.

Benefits:

    Encourages broader community participation.
    Smooth transition to a fully “hands‑off” model of oversight.

7. Comprehensive Documentation and Developer SDK

Improvement:
Develop a detailed developer SDK (Software Development Kit) and documentation package that includes reference implementations, integration guides, and sample code for service providers. This could be part of the standalone website.

Benefits:

    Lowers the barrier for new providers to integrate with the system.
    Ensures consistency in how metrics are recorded and reported.

Diagram Update

To reflect these improvements, update the system diagram by annotating the Governance layer with “Upgradeable Proxy” icons and detailed role-based access control indicators, and add a separate “Developer SDK & Documentation” module connected to the standalone website.
Pseudocode Enhancements

Below is a snippet showing how to integrate role-based access control using OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl in the Metrics Aggregator:

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract MetricsAggregator is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant DATA_UPDATER_ROLE = keccak256("DATA_UPDATER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant ATTESTER_ROLE = keccak256("ATTESTER_ROLE");

    struct Metrics { 
        uint256 subnamesMinted;
        uint256 resolutionsProcessed;
        uint256 burnRate;
        uint256 expenseRateSubname;
        uint256 lastUpdated;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Metrics) public providerMetrics;
    IEAS public eas;

    event MetricsAttested(address indexed provider, uint256 expenseRateSubname, uint256 timestamp, uint256 attestationId);

    constructor(address easAddress) {
        eas = IEAS(easAddress);
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
    
    // Only accounts with DATA_UPDATER_ROLE can update metrics
    function updateMetrics(address provider, uint256 additionalSubnames, uint256 additionalResolutions, uint256 newBurnRate)
        external onlyRole(DATA_UPDATER_ROLE) {
        Metrics storage m = providerMetrics[provider];
        m.subnamesMinted += additionalSubnames;
        m.resolutionsProcessed += additionalResolutions;
        m.burnRate = newBurnRate;
        m.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
        if(m.subnamesMinted > 0) {
            m.expenseRateSubname = m.burnRate / m.subnamesMinted;
        }
    }
    
    // Only accounts with ATTESTER_ROLE can trigger attestations
    function attestMetrics(address provider) external onlyRole(ATTESTER_ROLE) returns (uint256 attestationId) {
        Metrics memory m = providerMetrics[provider];
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(provider, m.subnamesMinted, m.resolutionsProcessed, m.burnRate, m.expenseRateSubname, m.lastUpdated);
        attestationId = eas.attest(data);
        emit MetricsAttested(provider, m.expenseRateSubname, block.timestamp, attestationId);
        return attestationId;
    }
}

Conclusion

The proposed system can be significantly improved by incorporating modular upgradeability, granular role-based access control, advanced on‑chain indexing, comprehensive performance metrics with automated remediation, enhanced integration with EAS, and a robust path to decentralized governance. Additionally, providing a comprehensive developer SDK and integrating these features into a centralized, standalone website will further streamline adoption and ensure that the entire process remains transparent and immutable. These improvements not only enhance security and efficiency but also support the long‑term vision of a decentralized, “hands‑off” system for ENS service provider oversight.

complete proposal do not leave anything out.. make it as long as you need

Below is the complete, final proposal that incorporates every aspect discussed—from the hierarchical, on‑chain attestation and registry system, to the integration of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for automatic, immutable performance metrics, to a developer relations (DevRel) function that ties ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers together. This document is designed for expert audiences and includes detailed pseudocode examples and a system diagram to illustrate the layered architecture.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal outlines a comprehensive, entirely on‑chain framework for establishing a Service Provider Advisory Board and Program for Season 2 within the ENS ecosystem. The system is designed to enforce rigorous technical and operational standards, automatically record and attest performance metrics via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), and maintain an immutable registry of official service provider contracts. In addition, the system functions as a DevRel hub that bridges the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community. A standalone website serves as a centralized, read‑only interface for stakeholders to access real‑time data and historical attestations. Ultimately, the long‑term vision is to transition to a decentralized, “hands‑off” governance model, where community‑driven processes autonomously ensure quality, security, and interoperability.
Abstract

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the decentralized web by converting cryptographic addresses into human‑readable names, sparking a new era of digital identity that is both liberating and transformative. As ENS continues its meteoric rise, it underpins an ever‑expanding ecosystem that includes wallet integrations, domain registrars, educational platforms, API aggregators, and more. However, rapid expansion has led to disparities in technical approaches, security protocols, and operational practices.

This proposal presents a hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation and registry system managed by the Service Provider Advisory Board. Leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), the system automatically records key performance metrics (including derived indicators like Expense Rate), verifies them on chain, and maintains a verifiable registry of official service provider contracts. It also supports advanced subdomain functionality via audited supplemental contracts and tiered fee structures, while functioning as a robust DevRel hub that links the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the development community. A standalone website will consolidate all board‑related documentation, performance dashboards, and support resources, ensuring transparency and ease of access.
Detailed Proposal
1. On‑Chain Attestation and Registry System
A. Service Provider Contract Layer

Each service provider deploys a smart contract that is instrumented to emit standardized events for key operations. These include:

    SubnameMinted Event: Emitted when a new subdomain is registered.
    ResolutionProcessed Event: Emitted when an ENS resolution is processed.
    BurnRateUpdated Event: Emitted when the service provider updates its monthly operational burn rate.

These events serve as the raw, on‑chain data that will be used to compute performance metrics.
B. Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer

A dedicated Metrics Aggregator contract aggregates event data from service provider contracts, computes derived metrics, and triggers attestations using EAS. The aggregator:

    Data Aggregation:
    Listens to events (either via direct function calls or by being called by provider contracts) to update cumulative metrics such as total subnames minted, total resolutions processed, and the current burn rate.

    Derived Metrics Calculation:
    Computes key performance indicators like the Expense Rate (e.g., if a provider burns $200/month and mints 100 subnames, the Expense Rate is $2 per subname).

    Automated Attestation:
    At defined intervals or when certain thresholds are met, the aggregator packages the data (including provider address, ENS name, aggregated metrics, and timestamps) and calls the EAS attestation function. The resulting immutable attestation record (with an attestation ID) is stored on chain.

C. Service Provider Registry Layer

A separate Service Provider Registry contract maintains a ledger of all official service provider contracts. For each registered provider, it stores:

    Contract Details:
    Ethereum address, ENS name, deployment date, and contract version.

    Attestation Record Links:
    An array of attestation IDs that link to historical performance attestations.

This registry provides an immutable, on‑chain record of all accredited service providers.
D. Governance and Oversight Layer

A Governance contract (or a multi‑sig governance mechanism) provides the Service Provider Registry Board with on‑chain control over the system. Its functions include:

    Parameter Updates:
    Allowing board members to update thresholds, fee structures, and other system parameters.

    Manual Attestation Triggers:
    Enabling board members to manually trigger attestations in case of anomalies.

    Registry Management:
    Approving, deprecating, or updating service provider registry entries through on‑chain votes.

Over time, the governance layer will facilitate a transition to a decentralized, “hands‑off” model where community‑driven processes maintain system integrity.
E. Standalone Website (Read‑Only Interface)

Although the system is entirely on chain, a standalone website (or dApp) will be developed to serve as the centralized user interface. It will:

    Query the on‑chain Metrics Aggregator and Service Provider Registry contracts.
    Display real‑time performance dashboards (including metrics like Expense Rate).
    Provide historical attestation records and registry details.
    Serve as a repository for accreditation guidelines, audit reports, and support resources.

This interface will abstract away the complexities of on‑chain data and present a streamlined view for experts and stakeholders.
2. Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

The Advisory Board will also function as a developer relations (DevRel) hub. Its responsibilities include:

    Facilitating Communication:
    Hosting weekly office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions to provide direct guidance and share best practices.

    Aligning with Core Development:
    Collaborating with ENS Labs to ensure that service provider standards are in line with ongoing protocol upgrades (e.g., ENS v2, Gasless DNS) and integrations with Layer 2 solutions like Base and Linea.

    Community Engagement:
    Acting as the central conduit between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers to drive continuous innovation and collaborative problem-solving.

3. Subdomain Oversight and Fee Mechanism

To enhance ENS utility and drive revenue, the system includes provisions for subdomain functionality:

    Supplemental Contracts:
    Service providers deploying subdomain solutions will implement supplemental contracts that are subject to on‑chain attestation via EAS.

    Tiered Fee Structure:
    A dynamic fee model will be implemented based on the number of subdomain registrants:
        Tier A: 1–500 registrants
        Tier B: 501–2500 registrants
        Tier C: 2501+ registrants

    As the number of subdomain registrants increases, a proportional share of the registration fees is directed to the DAO.

    Tokenized Metadata:
    Registrants will receive an ERC or soulbound token that includes metadata (e.g., registration date, duration, privileges, and on‑chain contribution history), enhancing transparency and building trust.

Pseudocode for Key Components

Service Provider Contract (Layer 1):

contract ServiceProvider {
    providerAddress = msg.sender
    ensName = input_ensName

    event SubnameMinted(timestamp, subnameId)
    event ResolutionProcessed(timestamp, resolutionId)
    event BurnRateUpdated(timestamp, burnRate)

    function mintSubname(subnameId) {
        // Mint subdomain logic
        emit SubnameMinted(current_timestamp, subnameId)
    }

    function processResolution(resolutionId) {
        // Process resolution logic
        emit ResolutionProcessed(current_timestamp, resolutionId)
    }

    function updateBurnRate(burnRate) {
        // Update burn rate logic
        emit BurnRateUpdated(current_timestamp, burnRate)
    }
}

Metrics Aggregator & Attestation Contract (Layer 2):

contract MetricsAggregator is AccessControl {
    struct Metrics {
        subnamesMinted: uint256
        resolutionsProcessed: uint256
        burnRate: uint256
        expenseRateSubname: uint256
        lastUpdated: uint256
    }
    
    mapping(address => Metrics) providerMetrics
    easAddress = EAS_contract_address

    event MetricsAttested(provider, expenseRateSubname, timestamp, attestationId)

    function updateMetrics(provider, additionalSubnames, additionalResolutions, newBurnRate) external onlyRole(DATA_UPDATER) {
        Metrics m = providerMetrics[provider]
        m.subnamesMinted += additionalSubnames
        m.resolutionsProcessed += additionalResolutions
        m.burnRate = newBurnRate
        m.lastUpdated = current_timestamp
        if (m.subnamesMinted > 0) {
            m.expenseRateSubname = m.burnRate / m.subnamesMinted
        }
        providerMetrics[provider] = m
    }
    
    function attestMetrics(provider) external onlyRole(ATTESTER) returns (attestationId) {
        Metrics m = providerMetrics[provider]
        data = encode(provider, m.subnamesMinted, m.resolutionsProcessed, m.burnRate, m.expenseRateSubname, m.lastUpdated)
        attestationId = EAS(easAddress).attest(data)
        emit MetricsAttested(provider, m.expenseRateSubname, current_timestamp, attestationId)
        return attestationId
    }
}

Service Provider Registry Contract (Layer 3):

contract ServiceProviderRegistry {
    struct ProviderRecord {
        contractAddress: address
        ensName: string
        deploymentDate: uint256
        version: string
        attestationRecords: uint256[] 
    }
    
    mapping(address => ProviderRecord) registry
    registeredProviders: array of addresses

    event ProviderRegistered(providerAddress, ensName, deploymentDate)
    event AttestationLinked(providerAddress, attestationId)

    function registerProvider(contractAddress, ensName, version) external {
        require(registry[contractAddress].deploymentDate == 0)
        record = ProviderRecord(contractAddress, ensName, current_timestamp, version, emptyArray)
        registry[contractAddress] = record
        append(registeredProviders, contractAddress)
        emit ProviderRegistered(contractAddress, ensName, current_timestamp)
    }
    
    function linkAttestation(contractAddress, attestationId) external {
        require(registry[contractAddress].deploymentDate != 0)
        append(registry[contractAddress].attestationRecords, attestationId)
        emit AttestationLinked(contractAddress, attestationId)
    }
}

Governance Contract (Layer 4):

contract Governance {
    aggregator = MetricsAggregator_address
    registry = ServiceProviderRegistry_address

    modifier onlyBoard() {
        require(isBoardMember(msg.sender))
        continue
    }

    function updateParameter(parameterName, newValue) external onlyBoard {
        // Update parameter logic
    }

    function manualAttestation(provider) external onlyBoard returns (attestationId) {
        attestationId = aggregator.attestMetrics(provider)
        registry.linkAttestation(provider, attestationId)
        return attestationId
    }
    
    function isBoardMember(user) returns (bool) {
        // Check membership logic (e.g., via a stored board members mapping)
    }
}

Integration via Standalone Website (Layer 5):

    The website acts as a read‑only interface that uses web3 calls to query the Metrics Aggregator, Registry, and Governance contracts. It displays:
        Real‑time performance dashboards (e.g., Expense Rate, subnames minted).
        Historical attestation records (attestation IDs with timestamps).
        The official registry of service provider contracts with metadata.

Long‑Term Vision: Decentralization and Autonomous Governance

While the system begins with active Board oversight, the long‑term goal is to transition to a decentralized, “hands‑off” model. As the community-driven processes mature and performance standards stabilize, the governance layer will gradually delegate oversight functions to on‑chain, automated mechanisms (e.g., via DAO proposals with quadratic voting or delegate override). This evolution will ensure that the system remains robust and self‑sustaining, minimizing direct intervention by central authorities.
Budget and Funding

The annual budget is projected at approximately $265,000, allocated as follows:

    Personnel Costs:
        Board member compensation: $100,000
        Administrative coordinator: $50,000

    Technical Infrastructure:
        Advanced communication and scheduling tools: $10,000
        Standalone website maintenance: $5,000

    Accreditation and Security Audits:
        Third‑party security audits: $50,000
        Accreditation operational costs: $20,000

    Community Engagement:
        Workshops and office hours: $15,000
        Outreach materials: $5,000

    Contingency:
        Unforeseen expenses: $10,000

Funding will be primarily sourced from ENS DAO treasury allocations (subject to governance approval) and supplemented by nominal accreditation fees, external grants, and sponsorships.
Conclusion

This proposal outlines a comprehensive, entirely on‑chain hierarchical system for attesting and registering ENS service providers. By leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for automated, immutable on‑chain attestations and maintaining an official registry through dedicated smart contracts, the system ensures that performance metrics and contract records are transparent, verifiable, and secure. The Advisory Board will function as both a governance body and a developer relations hub—bridging ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community—while a standalone website provides a centralized, user‑friendly interface to view real‑time data. With mechanisms for subdomain oversight, tiered fee structures, and tokenized metadata, this framework not only enforces the highest standards but also sets the stage for a long‑term decentralized, “hands‑off” governance model. We invite expert stakeholders to review this proposal, provide feedback, and support its implementation, ensuring that ENS remains at the forefront of digital identity and decentralized innovation.

Below is an integrated, polished excerpt that captures the strongest elements from all our versions—a complete, expert-level proposal excerpt for the ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2. This version emphasizes a fully on‑chain, hierarchical attestation and registry system leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), a robust accreditation process with performance metrics (such as Expense Rate), and a developer relations (DevRel) function that links ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader developer community. It also outlines a long‑term vision for autonomous, decentralized governance and includes detailed pseudocode and a system diagram.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal establishes an entirely on‑chain, hierarchical framework for the ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2. The system enforces rigorous technical and operational standards, automatically records and attests performance metrics via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), and maintains an immutable registry of official service provider contracts. Acting as a DevRel hub, the Board will link ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the development community, while a standalone website will serve as a centralized, read‑only interface for all on‑chain data. The long‑term vision is to transition toward a decentralized, “hands‑off” governance model.
Key Components
On‑Chain Attestation & Metrics Aggregation

Each service provider deploys a smart contract that emits standardized events—such as SubnameMinted, ResolutionProcessed, and BurnRateUpdated. A dedicated Metrics Aggregator contract collects these events, aggregates key data (e.g., total subnames minted, resolutions processed, monthly burn rate), and computes derived metrics like Expense Rate (burnRate divided by subnamesMinted). At predefined intervals, the aggregator encodes these metrics and submits them to the EAS, resulting in an immutable attestation record.
Official Registry and Governance

A Service Provider Registry contract maintains an immutable ledger of all officially endorsed service provider contracts, recording details such as ENS names, deployment dates, versions, and linked attestation records. Oversight is provided via a Governance contract (or multi‑sig system) controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board. This layer allows Board members to update system parameters, trigger manual attestations, and manage the registry—laying the groundwork for eventual autonomous, decentralized governance.
Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

The Board will serve as a DevRel hub, fostering continuous collaboration between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers. Regular office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions will provide direct technical support and ensure alignment with core ENS development efforts (e.g., ENS v2 upgrades, Gasless DNS, and Layer 2 integrations).
Subdomain Oversight

To support the advanced utility of subdomains, supplemental contracts will be deployed that enable secure subdomain registration under .eth TLDs. These contracts will be audited and attested via EAS, and a tiered fee structure (e.g., Tier A: 1–500, Tier B: 501–2500, Tier C: 2501+) will dynamically allocate fees to the DAO. Registrants will receive tokenized metadata (via ERC or soulbound tokens) that captures registration details and on‑chain contribution history.
Standalone Website

A dedicated, read‑only website will provide a unified interface that queries the on‑chain Metrics Aggregator, Registry, and Governance contracts. This portal will display real‑time dashboards, historical attestation records, and official provider data—abstracting away traditional forum clutter while ensuring transparency.

Funding will be sourced primarily from ENS DAO treasury allocations (subject to governance approval), supplemented by nominal accreditation fees and external grants/sponsorships.
Conclusion

This proposal defines a robust, entirely on‑chain hierarchical system for attesting and registering ENS service providers. Leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for automated, immutable attestations and maintaining an official contract registry, the system ensures that performance metrics (including Expense Rate) are transparently recorded and verifiable. The Advisory Board, serving as a DevRel hub, will bridge the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community to drive continuous innovation. With mechanisms for subdomain oversight, tiered fee structures, and tokenized metadata, this system not only enforces the highest standards but also sets the stage for a long‑term, decentralized “hands‑off” governance model. We invite expert stakeholders to review this proposal, offer feedback, and support its implementation to ensure that ENS remains at the forefront of digital identity and decentralized innovation.

Below is an enhanced, complete proposal that incorporates a hierarchical, hybrid on‑chain attestation and registry system designed to be controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board. This version has been refined based on best practices and recent community discussions, with an emphasis on a fully on‑chain solution using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). It also outlines a governance mechanism that gradually transitions oversight to a decentralized “hands‑off” model, while maintaining a robust Developer Relations (DevRel) function. The proposal includes detailed pseudocode examples and a system diagram.
ENS Service Provider Advisory Board & Program – Season 2 Proposal
Overview

This proposal defines an entirely on‑chain system to oversee ENS service providers. The system is structured in distinct, interrelated layers that include:

    Service Provider Contracts: Issued by providers to emit standardized events for critical operations.
    Metrics Aggregation and Attestation: An on‑chain Metrics Aggregator collects and computes performance data, then submits attestations via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).
    Official Registry: A Registry contract that permanently records and links official service provider contracts with their performance attestations.
    Governance: A Governance contract controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board to update parameters, trigger manual attestations, and manage the registry.
    User Interface: A standalone, read‑only website (or dApp) that queries on‑chain data to display real‑time metrics and historical records.

The long‑term goal is to ensure that as the system matures, oversight will eventually become decentralized and self‑sustaining through community‑driven mechanisms.
Detailed Proposal
1. On‑Chain Attestation and Registry System
A. Service Provider Contract Layer

Each service provider must deploy its own smart contract, which emits on‑chain events for:

    SubnameMinted: Emitted when a new subdomain is registered.
    ResolutionProcessed: Emitted when a resolution is processed.
    BurnRateUpdated: Emitted when the provider updates its operational burn rate.

These events provide the raw data required to compute performance metrics.
B. Metrics Aggregation and Attestation Layer

A dedicated Metrics Aggregator contract is responsible for:

    Data Aggregation: Listening to events from service provider contracts and updating cumulative metrics (e.g., total subnames minted, total resolutions processed, current burn rate).
    Derived Metric Calculation: Automatically computing the Expense Rate (burnRate divided by subnamesMinted). For example, if a provider’s burn rate is $200/month and it mints 100 subnames, the Expense Rate is $2 per subname.
    Automated On‑Chain Attestation: At predefined intervals or when triggered, the aggregator encodes the latest metrics (provider address, ENS name, aggregated metrics, timestamps) and calls the EAS attestation function. The resulting attestation record (with an attestation ID) is recorded on chain, providing a permanent, verifiable record.

C. Service Provider Registry Layer

A Registry contract will maintain an immutable ledger of all official service provider contracts. For each provider, it will store:

    Contract Details: Including the Ethereum address, ENS name, deployment date, and contract version.
    Attestation Records: An array of attestation IDs linked to the provider’s performance data. This registry ensures that only officially endorsed service providers are tracked and that their performance history is publicly verifiable.

D. Governance and Oversight Layer

A Governance contract, controlled by the Service Provider Registry Board, will:

    Manage Parameters: Allow board members to update system parameters (e.g., thresholds for attestation triggers or fee schedules).
    Trigger Manual Attestations: Provide functionality for board members to manually initiate attestations in exceptional cases.
    Manage the Registry: Approve, deprecate, or update registry entries via on‑chain voting or a multi‑sig mechanism. The governance layer is designed to evolve over time, eventually enabling a decentralized “hands‑off” oversight model where community‑driven processes ensure ongoing compliance.

E. Standalone Website (Read‑Only Interface)

A dedicated, standalone website will provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to:

    Query the Metrics Aggregator and Registry contracts for real‑time performance dashboards and historical attestation records.
    Access accreditation guidelines, audit reports, and support resources. This website abstracts away the complexity of direct on‑chain interactions while ensuring that all data remains immutable and fully verifiable.

2. Developer Relations and Ecosystem Integration

The Advisory Board will also function as a Developer Relations (DevRel) hub by:

    Facilitating Communication: Hosting weekly office hours, quarterly workshops, and panel discussions to provide technical support and share best practices.
    Collaborating with ENS Labs: Aligning service provider standards with ongoing protocol improvements (e.g., ENS v2, Gasless DNS) and integration with Layer 2 solutions.
    Driving Ecosystem Innovation: Serving as the central conduit between the ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and service providers to foster innovation and ensure that the system continuously meets evolving standards.

3. Subdomain Oversight and Fee Mechanism

To support the advanced use of subdomains without explicitly distinguishing organizational types:

    Supplemental Contract Oversight: Providers deploying subdomain solutions will use supplemental contracts that are audited and attested via EAS.
    Tiered Fee Structure: A dynamic fee model will determine registration fees based on the number of subdomain registrants (e.g., Tier A: 1–500, Tier B: 501–2500, Tier C: 2501+), with a proportional share of fees directed to the DAO.
    Tokenized Metadata: Registrants will receive an ERC or soulbound token that records key metadata (registration date, duration, privileges, on‑chain contribution history) to build transparency and trust.

6. Long‑Term Vision: Autonomous, Decentralized Governance

While initial oversight will be provided by the Board, the long‑term objective is to transition to a decentralized “hands‑off” model. As the system matures and community‑driven processes prove reliable, governance functions will gradually shift to automated on‑chain mechanisms, ensuring ongoing quality, security, and interoperability without constant direct intervention.
Conclusion

This proposal defines a robust, fully on‑chain hierarchical system for attesting and registering ENS service providers. Leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for automated, immutable attestations and maintaining a permanent registry via dedicated smart contracts, the system ensures that performance metrics (including Expense Rate) are transparently recorded and verifiable. The Advisory Board, functioning as a DevRel hub, will connect ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the developer community to drive innovation. Integrated subdomain oversight with a tiered fee structure and tokenized metadata further enhances revenue generation and user trust. With a dedicated standalone website providing a unified, accessible interface, and a roadmap toward decentralized, “hands‑off” governance, this proposal sets a bold course for the future of ENS service provider oversight. We invite expert stakeholders to review, critique, and support its implementation to ensure that ENS remains a beacon of digital identity and decentralized innovation for generations to come.
