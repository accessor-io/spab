# Structure and Governance of the Oversight Committee

## Composition

The Service Provider Oversight Committee will comprise a group of experts elected by the ENS community, including:

- **Technical Experts**: Individuals with deep knowledge of ENS protocols, Ethereum smart contract development, and blockchain technology, including expertise in Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) architecture.

- **Security Specialists**: Professionals experienced in blockchain security, cryptography, and threat mitigation, with specific knowledge of ENS-related vulnerabilities and attack vectors within the Ethereum ecosystem.

- **Service Provider Representatives**: Members from accredited service providers offering diverse perspectives based on practical experience with ENS integration and operation across various Ethereum-based applications.

- **User Advocates**: Representatives of the ENS user community to ensure that user interests and experiences are prioritized, particularly in areas of cross-chain usability and wallet integration within the Ethereum network.

- **Legal and Compliance Advisors**: Experts to navigate regulatory considerations and ensure compliance with relevant laws, particularly in areas of domain ownership and cross-border transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Election and Tenure

Committee members will be elected through a decentralized voting process facilitated by the ENS DAO, leveraging ENS tokens to enable proportional representation through a quadratic voting mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. Terms will be staggered to maintain continuity while allowing for fresh perspectives. A defined tenure (e.g., two years) with the possibility of re-election ensures accountability and sustained commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions within the committee will be made through a consensus-driven approach, with mechanisms to resolve deadlocks, such as supermajority voting or escalation to the ENS DAO for final arbitration. Transparency is paramount; therefore, meeting minutes, proposals, and decisions will be recorded on-chain where feasible using IPFS for document storage and Ethereum for transaction records, and published for community review.
