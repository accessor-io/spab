# ENS Service Provider Advisory Board (SPAB)

## Overview

The ENS Service Provider Advisory Board (SPAB) establishes the definitive quality assurance, technical standards, and oversight framework for all services built on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This project implements a hierarchical, on-chain attestation system using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to verify provider performance metrics, maintain an immutable registry of accredited service providers, and establish robust technical standards for ENS integrations.

## Key Components

1. **On-Chain Attestation System**: A fully on-chain metrics collection and attestation framework leveraging EAS
2. **Service Provider Registry**: An immutable, public registry of all accredited ENS service providers
3. **Technical Standards Framework**: Comprehensive specifications for ENS integrations and implementations
4. **Governance Mechanism**: A multi-tiered board governance system for oversight and accreditation
5. **Developer Relations Hub**: Resources, office hours, and support for the service provider community
