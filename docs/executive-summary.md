# ENS Service Provider Advisory Board: Executive Summary

## Vision & Mission

The vision of the ENS Service Provider Advisory Board is to establish the definitive quality assurance, technical standards, and oversight framework for all services built on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This ensures security, interoperability, and innovation within the ecosystem. The mission is to create and sustain a comprehensive, on-chain attestation system and service provider registry that upholds the highest standards for ENS integrations while fostering collaboration, innovation, and sustainable growth.

## Core Initiative Overview

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Service Provider Advisory Board is a critical infrastructure initiative aimed at standardizing, securing, and scaling the growing ecosystem of services built on ENS technology. As ENS continues to expand as the premier naming and identity layer for Web3, this initiative establishes a framework for implementing an on-chain attestation system using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to verify provider performance metrics. It also involves creating and maintaining an immutable registry of accredited service providers, developing standardized technical specifications for ENS integrations, fostering developer relations and ecosystem growth through structured programs, and establishing a sustainable revenue model through tiered accreditation and subdomain fees.

## Key Value Propositions

The SPAB acts as a crucial middle ground between end users, ENS entities, and service providers, functioning much like a developer relations team for the entire ecosystem. For the ENS DAO, it enhances protocol reputation through rigorous quality assurance, expands the ecosystem of secure, reliable integrations, provides additional revenue streams through accreditation and subdomain fees, and offers a structured feedback channel from service providers to core protocol development. For service providers, it offers official accreditation that increases user trust and adoption, technical support that reduces development cycles and costs, marketing exposure through official ENS channels, and streamlined access to ENS protocol changes and updates. For end users, it ensures quality assurance for ENS-integrated services, provides transparent metrics for informed service selection, enhances security through standardized implementations, and ensures a consistent user experience across the ecosystem.

The SPAB will also establish clear standards for a service provider funding stream program, creating transparent criteria for fund distribution based on technical innovation, user adoption metrics, security implementation, and ecosystem contribution. This program will allocate resources through a tiered approach, with funding distributions governed by on-chain voting and performance-based milestones to ensure accountability and maximum impact for the ENS ecosystem. By building trust between all stakeholders, the SPAB will incentivize continuous improvement among service providers, foster healthy competition, and strategically direct resources toward initiatives that advance the technical capabilities and market reach of the entire ENS network.

## Financial Overview

The projected annual operating budget of $265,000 will be primarily funded through ENS DAO treasury allocations and service provider accreditation fees, with a path to self-sustainability within 24 months. Key financial highlights include a Year 1 revenue of $386,250 from accreditation, subdomain fees, education, and sponsorships, and Year 1 expenses of $315,000 covering personnel, technical infrastructure, and professional services. The Year 1 net result is a positive $71,250, excluding initial DAO funding, with a break-even point in Q4 of Year 2. The 5-year DAO return is projected at $1,575,000 on a $415,000 initial investment.

## Strategic Impact

The SPAB initiative addresses critical market needs for quality assurance, security standards, and technical interoperability within the ENS ecosystem while creating sustainable value through technical excellence, developer empowerment, economic sustainability, and community growth. It ensures rigorous standards for secure, interoperable implementations, provides comprehensive support and resources that accelerate integration, establishes a multi-channel revenue model benefiting all ecosystem participants, and fosters strong developer and service provider networks that drive innovation. The Board will function as both a governance body and a developer relations hub, bridging ENS DAO, ENS Labs, and the broader development community, while establishing ENS as the gold standard for decentralized naming and identity services in Web3.
