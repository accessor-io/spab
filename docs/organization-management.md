QP  QQPPW # ENS Service Provider Advisory Board: Organization & Management Structure

## Legal Framework & Governance Model

### 1.1 Legal Structure

The ENS Service Provider Advisory Board (SPAB) will function as a semi-autonomous working group under the broader ENS DAO governance framework. This structure provides several advantages. Firstly, the board operates in accordance with ENS DAO principles and objectives while maintaining focused operational independence. Secondly, funding flows through established DAO mechanisms, ensuring proper oversight and accountability. Thirdly, the board leverages existing legal considerations already established for ENS DAO operations. Lastly, day-to-day operations remain agile while major decisions receive appropriate DAO-level scrutiny.

The legal structure will be formalized through a comprehensive governance proposal approved by ENS DAO token holders, establishing the board's scope of authority, resource allocation parameters, and accountability mechanisms.

### 1.2 Relationship with ENS DAO

The SPAB maintains a clearly defined relationship with the ENS DAO. The DAO delegates specific oversight responsibilities and decision-making authority to the board regarding service provider standards and accreditation. Initial and ongoing funding allocations are approved through standard DAO governance procedures. The board provides quarterly performance reports and annual comprehensive reviews to the DAO. Board members actively participate in broader ENS governance discussions to ensure alignment with ecosystem goals. Significant disputes or extraordinary circumstances have a clear path for escalation to full DAO governance.

## Board Composition and Selection

### 2.1 Board Structure

The SPAB will consist of seven core members with complementary expertise. These include two technical specialists who are smart contract and protocol experts with deep ENS-specific knowledge. Their responsibilities include technical standard development, implementation review, and security framework design. There will be one security auditor, a blockchain security specialist with experience in identity and naming systems, responsible for vulnerability assessment methodology, audit coordination, and security incident response. Two service provider representatives, leaders from established ENS integration companies or projects, will provide integration perspective, operational feasibility, and market feedback. A user advocate, a community representative focused on end-user experience and needs, will handle usability standards, accessibility requirements, and user feedback channels. Lastly, a legal and compliance advisor with regulatory expertise in decentralized identity and naming services will manage the compliance framework, legal risk assessment, and terms of service guidance.

Each board position has specific qualification requirements detailed in the board member selection guidelines document, ensuring all candidates possess the necessary expertise and commitment.

### 2.2 Selection Process

Board members are selected through a transparent, multi-stage process. The nomination phase lasts for two weeks, during which there is an open nomination period for candidates. Self-nominations and community nominations are accepted, and candidates must submit a standard application form including qualifications, experience, and a vision statement. This is followed by a one-week public vetting phase where candidates' applications are published to the ENS governance forum, community Q&A sessions with candidates are held, and background verification is conducted by existing board members for subsequent elections. The token-weighted voting phase lasts for one week, during which ENS token holders vote using token-weighted governance through a snapshot voting implementation. Voting criteria and a rubric are published. Finally, the onboarding phase involves the formal acceptance of position and responsibilities, knowledge transfer from outgoing members if applicable, and a public announcement of the new board composition.

### 2.3 Term Lengths and Continuity

To ensure both fresh perspectives and institutional knowledge, board members commit to a two-year term. Initial board members serve split terms, with three members serving for one year and four members for two years. There is a maximum of two consecutive terms for any position. Mid-term vacancies are filled through a special election for the remainder of the term.

## Decision-Making Framework

### 3.1 Voting Structure

The board employs a multi-tiered voting structure based on decision significance. Routine operational decisions require a simple majority of four out of seven members and include examples such as application reviews, workshop topics, and documentation updates. These decisions are implemented immediately upon approval. Technical standards changes require a supermajority of five out of seven members and include examples such as API specifications, security requirements, and testing protocols. These changes have a 30-day notice period before enforcement. Major policy updates also require a supermajority of five out of seven members plus a public comment period and include examples such as accreditation fee changes, compliance requirements, and registry rules. These updates have a 60-day notice period before enforcement. Budget allocations require majority approval for allocations within the pre-approved budget, while DAO-level approval is required for allocations exceeding $50,000 or 15% of the annual budget. Quarterly financial transparency reports are published to the community.

### 3.2 Meeting Cadence and Transparency

The board maintains a regular meeting schedule. Weekly operations meetings involve the core team and available board members. Bi-weekly board meetings require full board attendance and follow a structured agenda. Monthly public forums are open community meetings with Q&A sessions. Quarterly strategic reviews involve comprehensive performance assessment and planning. All board meetings follow a strict transparency protocol, with public agendas published 48 hours before meetings, live attendance options for non-sensitive portions, meeting minutes published within 24 hours, voting records publicly available, and executive sessions limited to sensitive matters such as security vulnerabilities and personnel issues.

### 3.3 Conflict Resolution

A formal conflict resolution process addresses disagreements. Initial mediation involves a chair-facilitated discussion seeking consensus. If necessary, formal position papers documenting conflicting viewpoints are reviewed by the board. An extended deliberation period allows for additional research and community input. A final decision vote follows, with a supermajority rule and formal recording of dissenting views. Critical deadlocks can be elevated to ENS DAO governance.

## Operational Team Structure

### 4.1 Core Team Roles

To support the board's strategic direction, a dedicated operational team will be established. The Program Director, a full-time role, serves as the primary liaison between the Board, ENS DAO, and service providers, managing overall program implementation, public representation, budget oversight, and resource allocation. The Technical Lead, also a full-time role, is responsible for standards development and maintenance, technical review of service provider implementations, integration guidance, and troubleshooting, and coordination with the ENS protocol development team. The Developer Advocate, another full-time role, handles community engagement and technical support, educational content creation, workshop facilitation, office hours, implementation assistance, and documentation management. The Operations Coordinator, a part-time role, provides administrative support for board activities, meeting coordination, communication management, metric tracking, reporting, budget administration, and vendor management.

### 4.2 Extended Support Roles

The operational team is supported by extended roles including a Security Auditor on contract, responsible for periodic review of service provider implementations, security assessment methodology development, vulnerability disclosure procedure management, and incident response coordination. Legal Counsel on retainer provides regulatory compliance guidance, terms of service and policy review, risk assessment for new initiatives, and dispute resolution support. Technical Writers on contract handle documentation and educational resources, integration guides and best practices, case studies and implementation examples, and user guides and explainers.

### 4.3 Reporting Structure

The operational team follows a clear reporting structure. The Program Director reports to the Board Chair. The Technical Lead, Developer Advocate, and Operations Coordinator report to the Program Director. Contract roles coordinate through their respective functional leads. Performance reviews are conducted quarterly, and compensation adjustments are reviewed annually.

## Ethical Framework & Accountability Mechanisms

### 5.1 Code of Conduct

All board members and operational staff adhere to a comprehensive code of conduct. This includes conflict of interest disclosure requirements, recusal procedures for decisions affecting personal interests, confidentiality obligations regarding sensitive information, professional conduct standards, and an anti-harassment policy. There is also a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

### 5.2 Accountability Mechanisms

Multiple accountability systems ensure proper governance. These include annual board member performance reviews, community feedback channels for board performance, transparent metrics published quarterly, regular self-assessment against stated objectives, and an independent audit of operations and finances annually.

### 5.3 Continuous Improvement Process

The organizational structure itself undergoes regular review. This includes an annual governance model assessment, stakeholder surveys regarding board effectiveness, benchmark comparison against similar web3 governance bodies, formal improvement proposals driven by data and feedback, and governance innovation exploration and implementation.
