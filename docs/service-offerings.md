# ENS Service Provider Advisory Board: Service Offerings & Value Proposition

## Core Service Portfolio

The ENS Service Provider Advisory Board (SPAB) provides a complete set of services to improve the quality, security, and compatibility of ENS services. These services are organized into four main areas:

### 1. Accreditation & Registry Services

#### 1.1 Provider Accreditation Program

The SPAB's main offering is a thorough, multi-step accreditation process that checks service providers against set technical and operational standards. The process starts with an initial application, where we review the provider's technical documents, security measures, performance capabilities, integration methods, and compliance records.

After the initial application, we conduct a technical evaluation. This includes reviewing code for ENS integration, checking for security vulnerabilities, assessing smart contracts (if used), testing performance under different conditions, and verifying compatibility with ENS standards.

Once the technical evaluation is done, we begin the on-chain verification phase. This involves setting up standard monitoring systems, implementing event tracking standards, connecting to the Metrics Aggregator, collecting performance data, and creating permanent verification records using EIP-482 compliant attestation protocols.

Providers can achieve different accreditation levels based on their performance: Standard for basic EIP-137 requirements, Advanced for better security and EIP-2304 feature implementation, and Premium for top-level implementation with CCIP-Read cross-chain compatibility and additional safeguards. Each level offers specific benefits and visibility in the provider registry.

#### 1.2 Public Registry of Verified Providers

A permanent, on-chain registry built on ERC-721 standards serves as the official record of accredited ENS service providers. The registry includes a permanent record of accredited providers, past verification records, performance statistics, service type classifications, and accreditation level details.

We ensure data transparency through live performance dashboards powered by The Graph protocol, past verification records stored on IPFS, comparison metrics between providers, standard assessment criteria, and verification status and compliance history. The user interface includes a searchable provider directory with ENS domain resolution, filters for service types and features, detailed provider profiles, direct links to services, and user feedback options.

#### 1.3 Continuous Monitoring & Compliance

We maintain accreditation through ongoing monitoring and regular reviews. Automated monitoring includes real-time data collection from provider systems using EIP-2362 standards, performance metric calculations, automatic verification updates, problem detection and alerts, and uptime tracking.

Regular reviews involve an annual check of all providers, updated security checks, implementation of new EIP standard requirements, user feedback analysis, and compliance verification with changing standards. Compliance management includes clear steps for fixing issues, a warning system for compliance problems, a transparent process for accreditation changes, appeal procedures, and a recovery program for suspended providers.

#### 1.4 Dispute Resolution Framework

We have a structured process for handling user concerns or provider conflicts. Complaint handling includes a standard submission process, initial review and sorting, technical verification of issues, documentation and evidence collection, and resolution tracking.

The mediation process includes neutral third-party review, technical investigation, guided resolution discussions, final decision procedures when needed, and an appeal process for major disputes. Remediation oversight ensures verification of required changes, follow-up compliance checks, documentation of resolution outcomes, public reporting of major cases (without identifying details), and pattern analysis for standards improvement.
