# Rationale for the Oversight Committee

The need for an oversight committee arises from several pressing considerations:

## Ensuring Technical Standards and Interoperability

ENS service providers employ a variety of technical implementations, leading to inconsistencies that can cause interoperability issues, user confusion, and potential security vulnerabilities. Standardizing technical protocols and best practices is essential to ensure that all services interact correctly with the ENS infrastructure and with each other, particularly in areas of EIP-137 resolution, EIP-2304 metadata handling, and CCIP-Read cross-chain compatibility.

## Enhancing Security Measures

The decentralized nature of blockchain technology does not inherently guarantee security. Service providers must implement rigorous security protocols to protect users from phishing attacks, domain hijacking, and other malicious activities. An oversight committee can establish mandatory security standards, including EIP-712 signature verification, multi-chain address resolution security, and regular smart contract audits to minimize risks.

## Promoting Reliability and Uptime

Users rely on ENS services for critical operations. Service disruptions can have significant repercussions. Establishing guidelines for service reliability, including uptime commitments and failover mechanisms, can enhance overall user trust and satisfaction, particularly for services handling ENS resolution across multiple EVM-compatible chains.

## Building User Trust and Adoption

Accreditation provides users with assurance that a service provider has been vetted and meets established criteria for quality and security. This trust is crucial for widespread adoption, as users are more likely to engage with services that have recognized endorsements, particularly when dealing with cross-chain ENS resolution and multi-signature domain management.

## Fostering Innovation and Collaboration

By bringing together service providers under a common framework, the committee can facilitate knowledge sharing, collaborative development, and collective problem-solving. This environment stimulates innovation while preventing the duplication of efforts and fragmentation of the ecosystem, particularly in areas of Layer 2 integration and cross-chain interoperability.
